An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by including crafted input as the argument of an affected configuration command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root on the PON controller.\r\n\r\nCisco plans to release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the configuration files on an affected system.

				"text": "Cisco plans to release software updates that address vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases or trains. The right column indicates whether a release (train) is affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n        Cisco Routed PON Controller Software in Cisco IOS XR1  First Fixed Release          7.11 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      24.1 and later  Migrate to a fixed release.      24.2 and later  Migrate to a fixed release.      24.3 and later  Migrate to a fixed release.      24.4.1 (Nov 2024)  Not vulnerable.\r\n1. Cisco Routed PON Controller Software is bundled with Cisco IOS XR Software as an optional RPM Package Manager.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to fixed software, a configuration change is required in the PonCntlInit.json file to use a keyring to store the MongoDB password.\r\n\r\nInstructions for PonCntlInit.json Configuration Change\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to fixed software, replace the MongoDB password field in the PonCntlInit.json file with the password_opts field, as shown in the following example.\r\n\r\nBefore the configuration change, the MongoDB password field will appear as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MongoDB\": {\r\n        \"auth_db\": \"tibit_users\",\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n      \"password\": \"MongoDBPassword\",\r\n.\r\n.\r\n}\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to fixed software, replace the MongoDB password field with the password_opts field, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MongoDB\": {\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\"password_opts\": {\r\n\"type\": \"keyring\",\r\n\"keyring_path\": \"/etc/cisco/poncntl/keyring.data\",\r\n\"keyring_key_path\": \"/etc/cisco/poncntl/keyring.key\"\r\n},\r\n.\r\n.\r\n}\r\n\r\nOnce the PonCntlInit.json file has been edited, update the Cisco IOS XR Software configuration to include the database password. Once the configuration is saved, the password will be shown in encrypted format when the show running-config command is performed, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#conf t\r\nWed Sep 11 16:00:00.000 UTC\r\nRouter(config)#pon-ctlr\r\nRouter(config-ponctlr)#cfg-file /harddisk:/PonCntlInit.json db-password <MongoDB Password>\r\nRouter(config-ponctlr)#end\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:Sep 11 16:00:00.000 UTC: config[67636]: %MGBL-SYS-5-CONFIG_I : Configured from console by admin\r\nRouter#show running-config pon-ctlr\r\nWed Sep 11 16:00:00.000 UTC\r\npon-ctlr\r\n cfg-file /harddisk:/PonCntlInit.json db-password 0525253C1E6E6925\r\n!\r\nRouter#",
