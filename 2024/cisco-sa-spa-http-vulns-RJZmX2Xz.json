An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overflow an internal buffer and execute arbitrary commands at the root privilege level.\r\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwk31988 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk31988\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20450, CVE-2024-20452, and CVE-2024-20454\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-20451 and CVE-2024-20453: Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series and SPA500 Series IP Phones Web UI DoS Vulnerability\r\n\r\nMultiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA300 Series IP Phones and Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities exist because HTTP packets are not properly checked for errors. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP packet to the remote interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the device.\r\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
