				"text": "A vulnerability in the Layer 2 Ethernet services of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the line card network processor to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of specific Ethernet frames that are received on line cards that have the Layer 2 services feature enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific Ethernet frames through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ingress interface network processor to reset, resulting in a loss of traffic over the interfaces that are supported by the network processor. Multiple resets of the network processor would cause the line card to reset, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75299\"].",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software and have an affected Layer 2 transport configuration enabled:\r\n\r\nASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers that have a Lightspeed-based or Lightspeed-Plus-based line card installed\r\nASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers\r\nASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers\r\nIOS XRd vRouters\r\nIOS XRv 9000 Routers\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nDetermine the Installed Line Cards\r\n\r\nTo determine which line cards are installed in a device, use the show platform CLI command.\r\n\r\nThe following line cards are Lightspeed-based:\r\n\r\nA9K-16X100GE-TR\r\nA99-16X100GE-X-SE\r\nA99-32X100GE-TR\r\n\r\nThe following line cards are Lightspeed-Plus-based:\r\n\r\nA9K-4HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA9K-4HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA9K-8HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA9K-8HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA9K-20HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA9K-20HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA99-4HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA99-4HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA99-10X400GE-X-SE\r\nA99-10X400GE-X-TR\r\nA99-32X100GE-X-SE\r\nA99-32X100GE-X-TR\r\n\r\nFor more information about line card type identification, see Understand ASR 9000 Series Line Card Types [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html\"].\r\n\r\nNote: At the time of publication, the lists of Cisco Lightspeed and Lightspeed-Plus product identifiers (PIDs) were accurate. For specific questions and further clarification about a PID, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).\r\n\r\nDetermine the Layer 2 Transport Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine if a device has an affected Layer 2 transport configuration, do the following steps:\r\n\r\nUse the show running-configuration command.\r\nLook for rewrite ingress tag pop on the l2transport interface in the output, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n!\r\ninterface HundredGigE0/0/0/12.1 l2transport\r\n encapsulation dot1q 2500\r\n rewrite ingress tag pop 1 symmetric\r\n!\r\n  If rewrite ingress tag pop is not present in the output, the device is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf rewrite ingress tag pop is present in the output, determine whether either of the following are present on the device:\r\nload-balancing flow src-dst-ip is present under the l2vpn configuration, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\nl2vpn\r\nrouter-id 1.1.1.1\r\nload-balancing flow src-dst-ip\r\n\r\nA service policy or access-control filtering mechanism that examines the IP headers is applied on the Layer 2 interfaces.\r\n  If either the configuration or the policy is present on the device, the device is vulnerable.",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.
