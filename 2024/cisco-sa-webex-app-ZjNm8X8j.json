In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-20395: Cisco Webex App Session Token Exposure Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the media retrieval functionality of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain access to sensitive session information.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insecure transmission of requests to backend services when the app accesses embedded media, such as images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a message with embedded media that is stored on a messaging server to a targeted user. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture session token information from insecurely transmitted requests and possibly reuse the captured session information to take further actions as the targeted user.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwj36941 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj36941\"], CSCwj36943 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj36943\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20395\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-20395: Cisco Webex App Windows Protocol Handler Credential Exposure Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the protocol handlers of Cisco Webex App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected application does not safely handle file protocol handlers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link that is designed to cause the application to send requests. If the attacker can observe transmitted traffic in a privileged network position, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to capture sensitive information, including credential information, from the requests.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwj36947 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwj36947\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20396\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N",
