An attacker in a machine-in-the-middle position could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
