				"text": "A vulnerability in the access control list (ACL) programming for port channel subinterfaces of Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send traffic that should be blocked through an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect hardware programming that occurs when configuration changes are made to port channel member ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access network resources that should be protected by an ACL that was applied on port channel subinterfaces.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the February 2024 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

In a regular ACL programming situation, the command is expected to return ACL entries that are associated to the subinterface in question, as seen in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos# show system internal access-list interface port-channel 10.10 input entries detail\r\nslot  1\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFlags: F - Fragment entry  E - Port Expansion\r\n       D - DSCP Expansion  M - ACL Expansion\r\n       T - Cross Feature Merge Expansion\r\n       N - NS Transit  B - BCM Expansion  C - COPP\r\n\r\nINSTANCE 0x0\r\n---------------\r\n  Tcam 1 resource usage:\r\n  ----------------------\r\n  LBL B = 0xa\r\n   Bank 1\r\n   ------\r\n     IPv4 Class\r\n     Policies: RACL(acl-10)\r\n       Netflow profile: 0\r\n       Netflow deny profile: 0\r\n       Entries:\r\n         [Index] Entry [Stats]\r\n         ---------------------\r\n  [0x001c:0x001e:0x001e] permit ip 0.0.0.0/0 10.10.1.11/32  routeable 0x1  [0]\r\n[0x001d:0x001f:0x001f] deny ip 0.0.0.0/0 10.10.1.12/32  routeable 0x1  [0]\r\n  [0x001e:0x0020:0x0020] deny ip 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0  routeable 0x1  [0]\r\n\r\nIf the command returns no entries for a port channel subinterface that is configured with an access list, ACL programming is affected, as seen in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos# show system internal access-list interface port-channel 10.10 input entries detail\r\n\r\nslot  1\r\n=======",

Proper ACL programming can be restored on any affected port channel subinterface by removing and reapplying the associated ip access-group configuration command. Reloading an affected device would also fix the ACL programming for all affected subinterfaces.\r\n\r\nWhile these workarounds have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.",

					"details": "There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAfter performing configuration changes to port channel member ports, verify whether the ACL programming is affected on any port channel subinterface, as shown in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory. Proper ACL programming can be restored on any affected port channel subinterface by removing and reapplying the associated ip access-group configuration command. Reloading an affected device would also fix the ACL programming for all affected subinterfaces.\r\n\r\nWhile these workarounds have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.",
