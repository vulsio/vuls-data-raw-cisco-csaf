A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web services user.

The port list will vary depending on the voice products and services in use. Some ports are ephemeral and will change after a restart.\r\n\r\nFor more information, see the Cisco Unified Communications Manager TCP and UDP Port Usage Overview section of the System Configuration Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Release 14 and SUs [\"https://www.cisco.com/content/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/admin/14/systemConfig/cucm_b_system-configuration-guide-14su2/cucm_m_tcp-and-udp-port-usage-12-0.html\"] or the version that corresponds with the deployed release, or the latest Port Utilization Guide for Cisco Unified Contact Center Solutions [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/icm_enterprise/icm_enterprise_12_5_1/configuration/guide/ucce_b_port-utilization_12_5/ucce_b_port-utilization_12_5_chapter_01000.html\"].\r\n\r\nAdditionally, follow the best practices that are described in the latest Security Guide for Cisco Unified Communications Manager [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/security/14SU2/cucm_b_security-guide-14su2/cucm_m_os-hardening.html\"] or the latest Security Guide for Cisco Unified ICM/Contact Center Enterprise [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/icm_enterprise/icm_enterprise_12_5_1/configuration/guide/ucce_b_125-security-guide/ucce_b_125-security-guide_chapter_0100.html\"].\r\n\r\nWhile this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions.

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following tables, the left column lists Cisco software releases.
