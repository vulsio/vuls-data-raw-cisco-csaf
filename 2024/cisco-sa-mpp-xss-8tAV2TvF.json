				"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web UI of Cisco Desk Phone 9800 Series, Cisco IP Phone 6800, 7800, and 8800 Series, and Cisco Video Phone 8875 with Cisco Multiplatform Firmware could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against users.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities exist because the web UI of an affected device does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\n\r\nNote: To exploit these vulnerabilities, Web Access must be enabled on the phone and the attacker must have Admin credentials on the device. Web Access is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n",
