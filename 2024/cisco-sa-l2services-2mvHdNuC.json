				"text": "A vulnerability in the handling of specific Ethernet frames by Cisco IOS XR Software for various Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) platforms could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause critical priority packets to be dropped, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect classification of certain types of Ethernet frames that are received on an interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific types of Ethernet frames to or through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause control plane protocol relationships to fail, resulting in a DoS condition. For more information, see the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75416\"].",

If output is returned, the device is affected, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS5501#show running-config | include l2transport\r\nTue Jan 16 01:14:07.977 UTC\r\nBuilding configuration...\r\ninterface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1.200 l2transport\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS5501#\r\n\r\nIf the output returns no information, the device is not affected by this vulnerability.",

				"text": "When specific frames are received on the Layer 2 interface, they are incorrectly classified as traffic class 7 virtual output queue (TC7 VOQ). If enough of these frames are sent at sustained rates, the VOQ will start to drop packets in TC7. The affected port is the interface by which the Layer 2 traffic receives egresses from the device. In most cases, this is the core interface of a service provider.\r\n\r\nBecause control plane traffic is also handled within this queue, this vulnerability could cause keepalive or hello packets to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition for protocols such as OSPF, Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (ISIS), Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD), Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), and Label Distribution Protocol (LDP).\r\n\r\nTo monitor the state of the VOQs, use the show controllers npu stats voq ingress interface command.

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases or trains. The right column indicates whether a release (train) is affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n        Cisco IOS XR Software Release  First Fixed Release          7.6 and earlier  Not affected.      7.7  Migrate to a fixed release.      7.8  Migrate to a fixed release.      7.9  Migrate to a fixed release.      7.10  7.10.2      7.11  7.11.1      24.1  24.1.1\r\nCisco has released the following SMUs to address this vulnerability.
