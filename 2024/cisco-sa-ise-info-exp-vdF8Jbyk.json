An attacker with read-only Administrator privileges for the web-based management interface on an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a page that contains sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information regarding the configuration of the system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address CSCwh78725 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh78725\"].
