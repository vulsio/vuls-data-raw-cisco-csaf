				"text": "A vulnerability in the PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) termination feature of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to crash the ppp_ma process, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the improper handling of malformed PPPoE packets that are received on a router that is running Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) functionality with PPPoE termination on a Lightspeed-based or Lightspeed-Plus-based line card. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PPPoE packet to an affected line card interface that does not terminate PPPoE. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the ppp_ma process, resulting in a DoS condition for PPPoE traffic across the router.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75299\"].",

If pppoe bba-group is present under the broadband aggregation (BBA) group, as shown in the following example, BNG PPPoE is enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR-9906-D#show running-config pppoe bba-group\r\nThu Feb 1 21:19:21.003 UTC\r\npppoe bba-group TS-PPPOE\r\nservice selection disable\r\n sessions max limit 32000\r\n!\r\nRP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR-9906-D#\r\n\r\nDetermine Whether BNG PPPoE is Enabled on an Interface\r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine whether an interface has BNG PPPoE enabled, use the show running-config interface | utility egrep \"interface|pppoe enable bba-group|bundle id\" command. If pppoe enable bba-group is configured on an interface or sub-interface, BNG PPoE is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output for a device that has the following characteristics:\r\n\r\nInterface Bundle-Ether41.50 has PPPoE enabled.\r\nInterface TenGigE0/3/0/0 is configured as part of Bundle-Ether41.\r\nInterface TenGigE0/3/0/0 is on a Lightspeed-Plus-based line card A99-4HG-FLEX-TR and has PPPoE enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP1/CPU0:ASR-9906-D#show running-config interface | utility egrep \"interface|pppoe enable bba-group|bundle id\"\r\nThu Feb 1 22:12:42.769 UTC\r\ninterface Bundle-Ether20\r\ninterface Bundle-Ether20\r\ninterface Bundle-Ether41\r\ninterface Bundle-Ether41.50\r\n pppoe enable bba-group TS-PPPOE\r\ninterface Bundle-Ether41.55\r\ninterface Loopback0\r\ninterface TenGigE0/3/0/0\r\n bundle id 41 mode on\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nNote: For clarity, the preceding output was altered to show fewer interfaces.",
