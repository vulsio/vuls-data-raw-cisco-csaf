While the Snort detection engine is restarting, traffic could bypass Snort inspection or be dropped, depending on the device configuration. For more information, see the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nThe Snort 2 and Snort 3 detection engines are both affected. The Snort detection engine will restart automatically. No manual intervention is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the October 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.
