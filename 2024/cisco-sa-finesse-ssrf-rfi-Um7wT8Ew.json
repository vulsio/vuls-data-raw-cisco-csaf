In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-20404: Cisco Finesse SSRF Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an SSRF attack on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain limited sensitive information for services that are associated to the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNote: The Security Impact Rating (SIR) is Medium due to the limited scope of information that is accessible to the attacker.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwh95292 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh95292\"], CSCwk36966 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk36966\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20404\r\nSeverity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.2\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-20405: Cisco Finesse Stored XSS through RFI Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack by exploiting an RFI vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for specific HTTP requests that are sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive information on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwh95276 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwh95276\"], CSCwk36966 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk36966\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20405\r\nSeverity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N",
