An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software and consuming available system resources.\r\n\r\nFor a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog [\"https://blog.clamav.net/2023/11/clamav-130-122-105-released.html\"].\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
