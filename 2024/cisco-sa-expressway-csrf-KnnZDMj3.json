In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-20252 and CVE-2024-20254: Cisco Expressway Series Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerabilities\r\nTwo vulnerabilities in the API of Cisco Expressway Series devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct CSRF attacks on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the API to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include modifying the system configuration and creating new privileged accounts.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwa25099  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa25099\"]and CSCwa25100 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa25100\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20252 and CVE-2024-20254\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.6\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-20255: Cisco Expressway Series Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the API of the Cisco Expressway Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the API to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the affected user has administrative privileges, these actions could include overwriting system configuration settings, which could prevent the system from processing calls properly and result in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in this section.\r\n        Cisco Expressway Series Release  First Fixed Release          Earlier than 14  Migrate to a fixed release.      14  14.3.41      15  15.0.01\r\n1. To enable the complete fix, run the xconfiguration Security CSRFProtection status : \"Enabled\" command, as detailed in the Cisco Expressway Administrator Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X15-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide-x15/exwy_m_expressway-interfaces.html#concept_B33F554ACD6AC1ABD864FA8949B6C408\"].\r\nCisco TelePresence Video Communication Server\r\n\r\nCisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) has reached its end-of-support date and is no longer included in Cisco Expressway Series advisories. Cisco has not released and will not release software updates for Cisco TelePresence VCS to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. Customers are advised to refer to the end-of-life notice for Cisco TelePresence VCS:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/unified-communications/telepresence-video-communication-server-vcs/eos-eol-notice-c51-743969.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/unified-communications/telepresence-video-communication-server-vcs/eos-eol-notice-c51-743969.html\"]\r\n\r\nWhen considering a software migration, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the new software will be sufficient for their network needs, that new devices contain sufficient memory, and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new product. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
