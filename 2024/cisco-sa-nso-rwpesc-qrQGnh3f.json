If a device is running a modified ncs.ccl clispec, if the ncs.ccl clispec has been removed, or if the ncs.ccl clispec is not configured on the device, then the device is affected.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the ncs.ccl clispec is running on a device, use the describe ping command, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nadmin@ncs> describe ping\r\n\r\nCommon\r\n    Source : clispec\r\n  File   : /opt/ncs/ncs-6.2.4/etc/ncs/ncs.ccl\r\n\r\nCallback [os command]\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\n\r\nIf the command returns a Source value of clispec and a File value of <nso installation dir>/etc/ncs/ncs.ccl, then the device is running the ncs.ccl clispec. The ncs.ccl clispec should be checked to see if it has been modified.\r\n\r\nIf the describe ping command produces output for the Source or File values that differs from the preceding example, then the device is affected, and no further checks are required. The following example shows output from an affected device:\r\n\r\n\r\nadmin@ncs> describe ping\r\n\r\nCommon\r\n    Source : built-in\r\n\r\nCallback [os command]\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\n\r\nDetermine Whether the ncs.ccl clispec Has Been Modified\r\n\r\nTo determine whether an administrator has modified the ncs.ccl clispec, calculate the hash of the ncs.cli clispec source file using the shasum -a 256 ncs.cli command from the source directory, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\n<nso_installation_path>/src/ncs/cli/ shasum -a 256 ncs.cli\r\n\r\n1bbcf2ec885311eed22a21644cbe02c211ee45e8a4ff2be56769324534a26f0d  ncs.cli\r\n\n\r\nIf the returned hash value matches the preceding example exactly, then the source file has not been modified.\r\n CVE-2024-20389\r\nOnly Cisco Crosswork NSO releases 6.0.11 and 6.2.1 are affected by the vulnerability that is described in CVE-2024-20389. All other software releases are not affected.",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n   Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following tables, the left column lists Cisco software release trains. The center column indicates the first release in each train that is affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
