				"text": "Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the Snort Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) rule engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured rules on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect HTTP packet handling. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured IPS rules and allow uninspected traffic onto the network.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the May 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: May 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75298\"].",

For more information on Snort, see the Snort website [\"https://www.snort.org/\"].\r\n  Cisco FirePOWER and Firepower Threat Defense Software\r\nAt the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco FirePOWER Services and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 4200 Series Firewalls if they were running Snort 3.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software  [\"#fs\"]section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nDetermine the Snort Configuration on Cisco FTD Software\r\n\r\nOn new installations of Cisco FTD Software releases 7.0.0 and later, Snort 3 is running by default. On devices that were running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0 or earlier and were upgraded to Release 7.0.0 or later, Snort 2 is running by default.\r\n\r\nTo determine if Snort 3 is running on Cisco FTD Software, see Determine the Active Snort Version that Runs on Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/secure-firewall-threat-defense/220415-determine-the-active-snort-version-that.html\"]. Snort 3 has to be active for this vulnerability to be exploited.\r\n    Cisco IOS XE Software\r\nAt the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Unified Threat Defense (UTD) Snort IPS Engine for Cisco IOS XE Software or UTD Engine for Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software:\r\n\r\n1000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)\r\n4000 Series ISRs\r\nCatalyst 8000V Edge Software\r\nCatalyst 8200 Series Edge Platforms\r\nCatalyst 8300 Series Edge Platforms\r\nCatalyst 8500L Edge Platforms\r\nCloud Services Routers 1000V\r\nIntegrated Services Virtual Router (ISRv)\r\n\r\nNote: UTD is not installed on these devices by default. If the UTD file is not installed, the device is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-app-bypass-cSBYCATq#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nDetermine Whether UTD Is Enabled\r\n\r\nTo determine whether UTD is enabled on a device, use the show utd engine standard status command. If the output shows a Yes under Running, UTD is enabled. If there is no output, the device is not affected. The following example shows the output on a device that has UTD enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show utd engine standard status\r\nEngine version       : 1.0.19_SV2.9.16.1_XE17.3\r\nProfile              : Cloud-Low\r\nSystem memory        :\r\nUsage  : 6.00 %\r\nStatus : Green\r\nNumber of engines    : 1\r\nEngine        Running    Health     Reason\r\n===========================================\r\nEngine(#1):   Yes        Green      None\r\n=======================================================\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\nFixed Releases\r\nFor information about fixed releases, see the following sections.\r\nOpen Source Snort Software\r\nAt the time of publication, the release information in the following table was accurate.\r\n   Snort ReleaseFirst Fixed Release 2.xNot vulnerable3.x3.1.69.0\r\n Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"]. This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nTo use the tool, go to the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nChoose which advisories the tool will search—all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR) [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr\"], or only this advisory.\r\nChoose the appropriate software.\r\nChoose the appropriate platform.\r\nEnter a release number—for example, 9.16.2.11 for Cisco ASA Software or 6.6.7 for Cisco FTD Software.\r\nClick Check.\r\n    Only this advisory All Critical and High advisories All advisories  Cisco ASA Software Cisco FMC Software Cisco FTD Software  Any Platform 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA) ASA 5500-X Series Firewalls ASA Service Module Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) Firepower 1000 Series Firepower 2100 Series Firepower 4100 Series Firepower 9000 Series Firepower NGFW Virtual Secure Firewall 3100 Series Firepower Management Center Appliances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor instructions on upgrading an FTD device, see Cisco Firepower Management Center Upgrade Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/upgrade/fpmc-upgrade-guide/getting_started.html\"].\r\n\r\n UTD\r\nAt the time of publication, the release information in the following table was accurate.
