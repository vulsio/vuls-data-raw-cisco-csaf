In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCisco Prime Infrastructure Command Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper processing of serialized Java objects by the affected application. An attacker with privileges sufficient to make application configuration changes could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a document containing malicious serialized Java objects to be processed by the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the application to execute arbitrary commands.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwf81859 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf81859\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20258\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCisco EPNM and Cisco Prime Infrastructure SQL Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco EPNM and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-submitted parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain and modify sensitive information that is stored in the underlying database.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwf81862 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf81862\"], CSCwf83557 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf83557\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20271\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\r\n\r\nCisco EPNM and Cisco Prime Infrastructure Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the application CLI of Cisco EPNM and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain elevated privileges.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper processing of command line arguments to application scripts. An attacker with privileges sufficient to log in with an interactive shell could exploit this vulnerability by issuing a command on the CLI with malicious options. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain the elevated privileges of the root user on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwf81865 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf81865\"], CSCwf83560 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf83560\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20260\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.0\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCisco EPNM and Cisco Prime Infrastructure XSS Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco EPNM and Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct XSS attacks.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker with privileges sufficient to access the web-based management interface could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious input that contains script or HTML content within requests that would be stored within the application interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct XSS attacks against other users of the affected application.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwf81870 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf81870\"], CSCwf83565 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf83565\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20257\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N",
