An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user, such as accessing password or log files or uploading and deleting existing files from the system.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwf41263 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf41263\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20352\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.9\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-20347: Cisco Emergency Responder CSRF Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in Cisco Emergency Responder could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack, which could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient protections for the web UI of an affected system.
