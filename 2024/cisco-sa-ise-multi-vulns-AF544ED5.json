In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-20476: Cisco ISE Authorization Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass the authorization mechanisms for specific file management functions.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to lack of server-side validation of Administrator permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files to a location that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid Read-Only Administrator credentials.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwk23108 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk23108\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20476\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2024-20487: Cisco ISE Stored XSS Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have at least a low-privileged account on an affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwk14907 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk14907\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20487\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N",
