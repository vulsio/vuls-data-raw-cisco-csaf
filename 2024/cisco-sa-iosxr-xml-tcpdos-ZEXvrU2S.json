				"text": "A vulnerability in the Dedicated XML Agent feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) on XML TCP listen port 38751.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of proper error validation of ingress XML packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sustained, crafted stream of XML traffic to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause XML TCP port 38751 to become unreachable while the attack traffic persists.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 2024 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2024 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75416\"].",

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n  Determine Whether Dedicated XML Agent Is Configured\r\nTo determine whether Dedicated XML Agent is configured on a device, use the show running-config “| include xml” command. If the command returns xml agent,1 the device is considered vulnerable, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config | xml\r\nxml agent\r\n\r\n1. The xml agent tty configuration command is a different service and does not indicate that the device is affected. If only the xml agent tty configuration command is present in the running configuration, the device is not affected. An affected device will return only the xml agent command.",

Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.",
