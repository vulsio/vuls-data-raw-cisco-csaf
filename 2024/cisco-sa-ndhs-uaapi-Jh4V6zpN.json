An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to an affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform limited network-admin functions such as reading device configuration information, uploading files, and modifying uploaded files.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability only affects a subset of REST API endpoints and does not affect the web-based management interface.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted API requests to the affected endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download config only or full backup files and learn sensitive configuration information.
