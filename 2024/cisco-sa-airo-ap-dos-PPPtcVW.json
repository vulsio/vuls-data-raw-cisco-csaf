				"text": "A vulnerability in the handling of encrypted wireless frames of Cisco Aironet Access Point (AP) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incomplete cleanup of resources when dropping certain malformed frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting as a wireless client to an affected AP and sending specific malformed frames over the wireless connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause degradation of service to other clients, which could potentially lead to a complete DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nAt the time of publication, the release information in the following tables was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n\r\nThe left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and which release included the fix for these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe process to upgrade an AP requires upgrading the wireless controller to which the AP is registered. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following tables:\r\n\r\nAPs Managed by Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) or Mobility Express (ME)\r\n           Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Release  First Fixed Release          8.4 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      8.5 releases earlier than 8.5.171.0  Not vulnerable.      8.5.171.0 and later  Migrate to a fixed release.      8.6  Not vulnerable.      8.7  Not vulnerable.      8.8  Not vulnerable.      8.9  Not vulnerable.      8.10 releases earlier than 8.10.130.0  Not vulnerable.      8.10.130.0 and later  8.10.190.81\r\n1. This fix is included only in a special engineering image. This image can be obtained from Cisco TAC through a TAC Service Request.\r\nAPs Managed by Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controller or Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC)\r\n           Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controller Software Release  First Fixed Release          16.11 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      16.12 releases earlier than 16.12.4a  Not vulnerable.      16.12.4a and later  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.1  Not vulnerable.      17.2  Not vulnerable.      17.3  17.3.9      17.4  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.5  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.6  17.6.7      17.7  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.8  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.9  17.9.5      17.10  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.11  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.12  17.12.2      17.13  Not vulnerable.\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
