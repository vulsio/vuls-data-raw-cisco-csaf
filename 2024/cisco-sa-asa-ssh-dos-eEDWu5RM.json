				"text": "A vulnerability in the SSH server of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition for the SSH server of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a logic error when an SSH session is established. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SSH messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust available SSH resources on the affected device so that new SSH connections to the device are denied, resulting in a DoS condition. Existing SSH connections to the device would continue to function normally. The device must be rebooted manually to recover. However, user traffic would not be impacted and could be managed using a remote application such as Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM).\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the October 2024 release of the Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: October 2024 Semiannual Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75300\"].",

The SSH server is enabled when the administrator allows SSH access from at least one host using the ssh  { ip_address mask | ipv6_address/prefix } interface command.\r\n\r\nIf a device is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.4.67 or 9.16.4.70 and has SSH enabled, it is affected by this vulnerability. If the device is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.18.4.40 or 9.20.3, it is affected by this vulnerability only if the show running-config command returns no ssh stack ciscossh, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nasa# show running-config ssh | include stack\r\nno ssh stack ciscossh",

To determine the current number of active SSH sessions on a device, use the show resource usage command and inspect the SSH Server row.

For more information about implementing this command, see the ssh stack ciscossh [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa-cli-reference/S/asa-command-ref-S/so-st-commands.html#wp8411317820\"] section of Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Series Command Reference.\r\n\r\nWhile this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions.

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\nCisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"]. This tool identifies any Cisco security advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities that are described in all the advisories that the Software Checker identifies (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nTo use the tool, go to the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] page and follow the instructions. Alternatively, use the following form to search for vulnerabilities that affect a specific software release. To use the form, follow these steps:\r\n\r\nChoose which advisories the tool will search—all advisories, only advisories with a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR) [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#asr\"], or only this advisory.\r\nChoose the appropriate software.\r\nChoose the appropriate platform.\r\nEnter a release number—for example, 9.16.2.11 for Cisco ASA Software or 6.6.7 for Cisco FTD Software.\r\nClick Check.\r\n    Only this advisory All Critical and High advisories All advisories  Cisco ASA Software Cisco FMC Software Cisco FTD Software  Any Platform 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA) ASA 5500-X Series Firewalls ASA Service Module Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) Firepower 1000 Series Firepower 2100 Series Firepower 4100 Series Firepower 9000 Series Firepower NGFW Virtual Secure Firewall 3100 Series Firepower Management Center Appliances\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: For Cisco 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs) that are running Cisco ASA Software, Cisco ASA Software Release 9.16.4.67 has been deferred and replaced by Release 9.16.4.70.\r\nAdditional Resources\r\nFor help determining the best Cisco ASA, FMC, or FTD Software release, see the following Recommended Releases documents.
