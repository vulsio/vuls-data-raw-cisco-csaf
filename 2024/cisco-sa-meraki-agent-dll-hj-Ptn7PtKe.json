A low-privileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing both malicious configuration files and malicious DLL files on an affected system, which would read and execute the files when Cisco Meraki SM launches on startup. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with SYSTEM privileges.\r\n\r\nCisco Meraki has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco End User License Agreement and applicable Product Specific Terms:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco Meraki directly, or through a Cisco Meraki authorized reseller or partner. In most cases, this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nCustomers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco Meraki products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. Cisco Meraki recommends utilizing firmware best practices [\"https://documentation.meraki.com/Architectures_and_Best_Practices/Cisco_Meraki_Best_Practice_Design/Best_Practices_for_Meraki_Firmware\"] for firmware updates.
