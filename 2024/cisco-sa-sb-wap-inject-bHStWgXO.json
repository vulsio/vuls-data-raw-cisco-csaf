An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the device.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
