				"text": "A vulnerability in the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)  specification (RFC793) has been discovered by an external researcher. The  successful exploitation enables an adversary to reset any established TCP  connection in a much shorter time than was previously discussed publicly.  Depending on the application, the connection may get automatically  re-established. In other cases, a user will have to repeat the action (for  example, open a new Telnet or SSH session). Depending upon the attacked  protocol, a successful attack may have additional consequences beyond  terminated connection which must be considered. This attack vector is only  applicable to the sessions which are terminating on a device (such as a router,  switch, or computer), and not to the sessions that are only passing through the  device (for example, transit traffic that is being routed by a router). In  addition, the attack vector does not directly compromise data integrity or  confidentiality.\r\n\r\n All Cisco products which contain a TCP stack are susceptible to this  vulnerability.\r\n\r\n This advisory is available at    http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20040420-tcp-nonios [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20040420-tcp-nonios\"],  and it describes this vulnerability as it applies to Cisco products that do not  run Cisco IOSÂ® software.\r\n\r\n A companion advisory that describes this vulnerability for products  that run Cisco IOS software is available at  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20040420-tcp-ios [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20040420-tcp-ios\"].",

				"text": "TCP is the transport layer protocol designed to provide  connection-oriented reliable delivery of a data stream. To accomplish this, TCP  uses a mixture of flags to indicate state and sequence numbers to identify the  order in which the packets are to be reassembled. TCP also provides a number,  called an acknowledgement number, that is used to indicate the sequence number  of the next packet expected. The packets are reassembled by the receiving TCP  implementation only if their sequence numbers fall within a range of the  acknowledgement number (called a \"window\"). The acknowledgement number is not  used in a packet with the reset (RST) flag set because a reset does not expect  a packet in return. The full specification of the TCP protocol can be found at    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0793.txt [\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0793.txt\"]  .\r\n\r\n According to the RFC793 specification, it is possible to reset an  established TCP connection by sending a packet with the RST or synchronize  (SYN) flag set. In order for this to occur, the 4-tuple must be known or  guessed (source and destination IP address and ports) together with a sequence  number. However, the sequence number does not have to be an exact match; it is  sufficient to fall within the advertised window. This significantly decreases  the effort required by an adversary: the larger the window, the easier it is to  reset the connection. While source and destination IP addresses may be  relatively easy to determine, the source TCP port must be guessed. The  destination TCP port is usually known for all standard services (for example,  23 for Telnet, 80 for HTTP). Many operating systems (OSs) use predictable  ephemeral ports for known services with a predictable increment (the next port  which will be used for a subsequent connection). These values, while constant  for a particular OS and protocol, do vary from one OS release to another.\r\n\r\n Here is an example of a normal termination of a TCP session:\r\n\r\n\r\n                Host(1)                       Host(2)\r\n                  |                             |                    |                             |                    |  ACK ack=1001, window=5000  |                    |<----------------------------|                    |                             |                      Host(1) is             closing the session                          |        RST seq=1001         |                    |---------------------------->|                    |                             |                                                    Host(2) is                                            closing the session\r\n\r\n In addition, the following scenario is also permitted:\r\n\r\n\r\n                Host(1)                       Host(2)\r\n                  |                             |                    |                             |                    |  ACK ack=1001, window=5000  |                    |<----------------------------|                    |                             |                      Host(1) is             closing the session                          |        RST seq=4321         |                    |---------------------------->|                    |                             |                                                    Host(2) is                                            closing the session\r\n\r\n Note how the RST packet was able to terminate the session although the  sequence number was not the next expected one (which is 1001). It was  sufficient for the sequence number to fall within the advertised \"window\". In  this example, Host(2) was accepting sequence numbers from 1001 to 6001 and 4321  is clearly within the acceptable range.\r\n\r\nCisco fixed this vulnerability in accordance with the  http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tcpm-tcpsecure-02.txt [\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tcpm-tcpsecure-02\"]  .\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, all protocols where a TCP connection stays  established for longer than one minute should be considered exposed.",

				"text": "The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer  situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and  organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,  customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to  ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended  network before it is deployed.\r\n\r\n There are no workarounds available to mitigate the effects of this  vulnerability.\r\n\r\n It is possible to mitigate the exposure on this vulnerability by  applying anti-spoofing measures on the edge of the network.\r\n\r\n By enabling Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), all spoofed  packets will be dropped at the first device. To enable uRPF, use the following  commands.\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter(config)#ip cef\r\n  router(config)#interface <interface> <interface #>      router(config-if)#ip verify unicast reverse-path\r\n\r\n Please consult  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t13/feature/guide/ft_urpf.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t13/feature/guide/ft_urpf.html\"]  and   ftp://ftp-eng.cisco.com/cons/isp/security/URPF-ISP.pdf [\"ftp://ftp-eng.cisco.com/cons/isp/security/URPF-ISP.pdf\"] for further  descriptions of how uRPF works and how to configure it in various scenarios.  This is especially important if you are using asymmetric routing.\r\n\r\n Access control lists (ACLs) should also be deployed as close to the  edge as possible. Unlike uRPF, you must specify the exact IP range that is  permitted. Specifying which addresses should be blocked is not the optimal  solution because it tends to be harder to maintain.\r\n\r\n    Caution: In order for anti-spoofing measures to be effective, they must be  deployed at least one hop away from the devices which are being protected.  Ideally, they will be deployed at the network edge.",

				{
					"category": "workaround",
					"details": "The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer  situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and  organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,  customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to  ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended  network before it is deployed.\r\n\r\n There are no workarounds available to mitigate the effects of this  vulnerability.\r\n\r\n It is possible to mitigate the exposure on this vulnerability by  applying anti-spoofing measures on the edge of the network.\r\n\r\n By enabling Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), all spoofed  packets will be dropped at the first device. To enable uRPF, use the following  commands.\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter(config)#ip cef\r\n  router(config)#interface <interface> <interface #>      router(config-if)#ip verify unicast reverse-path\r\n\r\n Please consult  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t13/feature/guide/ft_urpf.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t13/feature/guide/ft_urpf.html\"]  and   ftp://ftp-eng.cisco.com/cons/isp/security/URPF-ISP.pdf [\"ftp://ftp-eng.cisco.com/cons/isp/security/URPF-ISP.pdf\"] for further  descriptions of how uRPF works and how to configure it in various scenarios.  This is especially important if you are using asymmetric routing.\r\n\r\n Access control lists (ACLs) should also be deployed as close to the  edge as possible. Unlike uRPF, you must specify the exact IP range that is  permitted. Specifying which addresses should be blocked is not the optimal  solution because it tends to be harder to maintain.\r\n\r\n    Caution: In order for anti-spoofing measures to be effective, they must be  deployed at least one hop away from the devices which are being protected.  Ideally, they will be deployed at the network edge."
