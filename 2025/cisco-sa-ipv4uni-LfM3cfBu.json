				"text": "A vulnerability in the IPv4 access control list (ACL) feature and quality of service (QoS) policy feature of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, ASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers, and ASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed IPv4 packets that are received on line cards where the interface has either an IPv4 ACL or QoS policy applied. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv4 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause network processor errors, resulting in a reset or shutdown of the network process. Traffic over that line card would be lost while the line card reloads.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability has predominantly been observed in Layer 2 VPN (L2VPN) environments where an IPv4 ACL or QoS policy has been applied to the bridge virtual interface. Layer 3 configurations where the interface has either an IPv4 ACL or QoS policy applied are also affected, though the vulnerability has not been observed.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. There are mitigations that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 2025 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2025 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75548\"].",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software and have a vulnerable configuration enabled for any of the installed line cards:\r\n\r\nASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers if they have a Lightspeed- or Lightspeed-Plus-based line card installed\r\nASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers\r\nASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory. Consult Cisco IOS XR Software for ASR 9000 Series Routers Layer 3 Multicast Denial of Service Vulnerability [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-multicast-ERMrSvq7\"] before installing fixed software or an SMU to address this vulnerability.\r\n  Determine Which Line Cards Are Installed\r\nTo determine which line cards are installed in the device, use the show platform CLI command.\r\n\r\nCisco ASR 9902 and 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers integrate a Lightspeed-Plus-based line card.\r\n\r\nThe following line cards are Lightspeed-based:\r\n\r\nA9K-16X100GE-TR\r\nA99-16X100GE-X-SE\r\nA99-32X100GE-TR\r\n\r\nThe following line cards are Lightspeed-Plus-based:\r\n\r\nA9K-4HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA9K-4HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA9K-8HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA9K-8HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA9K-20HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA9K-20HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA99-4HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA99-4HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA99-10X400GE-X-SE\r\nA99-10X400GE-X-TR\r\nA99-32X100GE-X-SE\r\nA99-32X100GE-X-TR\r\n\r\nFor more information about line card type identification, see ASR 9000 Series Line Card Types [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html\"].\r\n\r\nNote: The Cisco Lightspeed-Plus list of product identifiers was accurate at the time of publication. For specific questions and further clarification about a product identifier, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).\r\n  Determine Whether a Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration\r\nA device is vulnerable if both of the following are true:\r\n\r\nAn IPv4 ACL group or a QoS policy is applied to a Layer 2, Layer 3, or bridge virtual interface in either the ingress or egress direction.\r\nThe IPv4 ACL group or QoS policy is on an interface that resides on either the Lightspeed or Lightspeed-Plus card.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a service-policy attached to interface TenGigE0/0/0/0 and an IPv4 access-group applied to interface TenGigE0/0/0/1.\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config\r\ninterface TenGigE0/0/0/0\r\n.\r\n.\r\nservice-policy input QoS_INGRESS\r\nservice-policy output QoS_EGRESS\r\n.\r\n.\r\ninterface TenGigE0/0/0/1\r\n.\r\n.\r\nipv4 access-group ACL_INGRESS ingress\r\nipv4 access-group ACL_EGRESS egress\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nRouter#",
