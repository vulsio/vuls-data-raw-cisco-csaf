				"text": "A vulnerability in confederation implementation for the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a memory corruption that occurs when a BGP update is created with an AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE attribute that has 255 autonomous system numbers (AS numbers). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP update message, or the network could be designed in such a manner that the AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE attribute grows to 255 AS numbers or more. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory corruption, which may cause the BGP process to restart, resulting in a DoS condition. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must control a BGP confederation speaker within the same autonomous system as the victim, or the network must be designed in such a manner that the AS_CONFED_SEQUENCE attribute grows to 255 AS numbers or more.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 2025 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2025 Semiannual Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-75548\"].",

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n\r\nDetermine the Device Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the device has BGP confederation configured, use the show running-config router bgp EXEC CLI command. If the router is configured for BGP, this command will return output. For the device to be considered vulnerable, the bgp confederation peers configuration command must also be present in the output, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\n# show running-config router bgp\r\nrouter bgp 64500\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nbgp confederation peers",
