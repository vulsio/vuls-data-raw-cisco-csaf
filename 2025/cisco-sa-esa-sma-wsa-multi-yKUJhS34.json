In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n  CVE-2024-20184: Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Web Appliance Command Injection Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform command injection attacks against an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of XML configuration files by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML configuration file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject commands to the underlying operating system with root privileges.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwk70559 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk70559\"], CSCwk70576 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk70576\"], CSCwk98506 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk98506\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20184\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n    CVE-2024-20185: Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, Cisco Secure Email Gateway, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the implementation of the remote access functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, Cisco Secure Email Gateway, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an architectural flaw in the password generation algorithm for the remote access functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a temporary password for the service account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root and access the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nNote: The Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is Medium due to the unrestricted scope of information that is accessible to an attacker.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwk70590 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk70590\"], CSCwk70547 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk70547\"], CSCwk70574 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwk70574\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2024-20185\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 3.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N",

Migrate to a fixed release.      15.2  15.2.2-009  15.2.2-009\r\nIn most cases, the software can be upgraded over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the web-based management interface of the appliance. To upgrade a device by using the web-based management interface, do the following:\r\n\r\nChoose System Administration > System Upgrade.\r\nClick Upgrade Options.\r\nClick Download and Install.\r\nChoose a release to upgrade to.\r\nIn the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.\r\nClick Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.\r\n\r\nCisco Secure Email Cloud includes Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager devices as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting the Cisco TAC.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
