An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials for a user account with at least the role of Operator.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nAt the time of publication, the release information in the following tables was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n\r\nThe left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSecure Email and Web Manager\r\n        Cisco AsyncOS Software Release  First Fixed Release          15.0 and earlier  Migrate to a fixed release.      15.5  15.5.3-017      16.0  16.0.1-010\r\nSecure Email Gateway\r\n        Cisco AsyncOS Software Release  First Fixed Release          15.0 and earlier  Migrate to a fixed release.      15.5  15.5.3-022      16.0  16.0.1-017\r\nIn most cases, the software can be upgraded over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the web-based management interface of the appliance. To upgrade a device by using the web-based management interface, do the following:\r\n\r\nChoose System Administration > System Upgrade.\r\nClick Upgrade Options.\r\nClick Download and Install.\r\nChoose a release to upgrade to.\r\nIn the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.\r\nClick Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.\r\n\r\nCisco Secure Email Cloud includes Cisco Secure Email Gateway and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager devices as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting the Cisco TAC.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
