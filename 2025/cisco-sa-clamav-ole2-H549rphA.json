An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted file containing OLE2 content to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate the ClamAV scanning process, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected software.\r\n\r\nFor a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog [\"https://blog.clamav.net/2025/01/clamav-142-and-108-security-patch.html\"].\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
