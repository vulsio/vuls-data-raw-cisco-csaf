An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP request with a crafted range request header through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to evade the antivirus scanner and download malware onto the endpoint without detection by Cisco Secure Web Appliance.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nAt the time of publication, the release information in the following table was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n\r\nThe left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n        Cisco AsyncOS for Secure Web Appliance Software Release  First Fixed Release          14.0 and earlier  Migrate to a fixed release.      14.5  Migrate to a fixed release.      15.0  15.0.1-004      15.1  Migrate to a fixed release.      15.2  15.2.1-011\r\nIn most cases, the software can be upgraded over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the web interface of the appliance. To upgrade a device by using the web interface, do the following:\r\n\r\nChoose System Administration > System Upgrade.\r\nClick Upgrade Options.\r\nChoose Download and Install.\r\nChoose the release to upgrade to.\r\nIn the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.\r\nClick Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
