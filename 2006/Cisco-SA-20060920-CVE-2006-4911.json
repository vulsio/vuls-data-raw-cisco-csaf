				"text": "Cisco Intrusion Prevention System versions prior to 5.1(2) contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security scanning.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle fragmented packets.  An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending network requests in such a way that IPS detection rules are not triggered.  This can allow an attacker to circumvent IPS scanning and protection, allowing the attacker to potentially pass malicious traffic on secure networks.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security advisory and released updated software that corrects it.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAttackers may attempt to exploit this vulnerability to carry out attacks against secondary targets.  Because the attacker can pass malicious traffic without scanning, IPS devices would be unable to mitigate such attacks.  It is likely that this type of vulnerability will be utilized in targeted attacks where the attacker has intimate knowledge of the network topology.\r\n",
