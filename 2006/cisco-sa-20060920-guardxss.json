				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Guard may enable an attacker to send a web  browser client to a malicious website with the use of Cross Site Scripting  (XSS) when the Guard is providing anti-spoofing services between the web  browser client and a webserver. The attacker may exploit this by providing a  malicious URL for the web browser client to go to, often in email, followed off  of a malicious website, or in an instant message. This issue may occur even if  the protected website does not allow XSS. A software upgrade is required to fix  this vulnerability. There is a workaround available to mitigate the effects of  the vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20060920-guardxss [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20060920-guardxss\"].",

An example of each method is shown  here:\r\n\r\n   Virtual terminal or local serial console connection\r\nTo determine the software version number through the local serial console use a serial cable and a terminal emulation program to connect to the appliance. Once you are connected, press the Enter key of your terminal and the Guard will present, without even logging in, the version of the software running on the devices:\r\nCisco Guard Version 3.1(0.12)\n GUARD login:\r\n    In this example the Cisco Guard is running software version 3.1.\r\nFor a virtual terminal, the procedure is the same except that no serial cable or terminal emulation program is needed (a standard keyboard and monitor are directly connected to the appliance).\r\n\r\n   Remote Secure Shell (SSH) connection\r\nTo obtain the software version number through a SSH session, use a SSH client to log in to the Cisco Guard and issue the show version command-line interface (CLI) command.\r\nprompt$ ssh admin@guard.example.com\nadmin@guard.example.com's password: Last login: Wed Nov 24 22:45:53 on ttyS0 admin@GUARD#show version Copyright (c) 2000-2004 Cisco Systems, Inc.

				"text": "The Cisco Guard DDoS Mitigation Appliance is a distributed  denial-of-service (DDoS) protection system. Malicious DOS traffic is identified  with a Cisco Detector and diverted to the Guard for attack mitigation. Under  normal circumstances, the Guard plays no role in valid traffic; it is  specifically designed to deal with large volumes of invalid traffic.\r\n\r\n Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is an attack where a user follows a link  that contains an embedded script. The link often looks valid, and sends the  user to a valid site. The recipient website does not contain the link that is  sent and sends a meta-refresh back to the user without validating the data it  is sent. When receiving the meta-refresh, the web browser interprets the script  as an instruction from the website and the script is executed on the user's  machine .\r\n\r\n In this case, when the anti-spoofing feature is enabled, all diverted  HTTP traffic is inspected and then a meta-refresh is sent to the client  containing the original request. If the original URL contains a script and a  specific character sequence, the meta-refresh from the Guard will allow the  client machine to execute the malicious script.\r\n\r\n Several conditions are required to be true in order for the malicious  script to be processed:\r\n\r\n   The client user must follow a URL with a specifically formatted, embedded script to a site protected by the Guard.\r\n\r\n   The Guard must be running active basic protection, going through basic/redirect protection.\r\n\r\n   The specially crafted http request must be diverted through the Guard, and processed by the Guard.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly if all of the above conditions are met will the client receive the  meta-refresh and process the embedded script.\r\n\r\n This vulnerability is being tracked by bug ID  CSCsf01438 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsf01438\"]            ( registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)         .",
