				"text": "This vulnerability affects any device that runs Cisco IOS and has  enabled the SGBP protocol. SGBP is enabled by defining a stack group, which is  done using the global IOS command sgbp group  <name>. The presence of this command will cause the  device to begin listening on port 9900, even if the remaining SGBP parameters  are not fully configured.\r\n\r\nThe following examples demonstrate device configurations for which SGBP  is enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show sgbp\nGroup Name: test Ref: 0xA3728C00 Seed bid: default, 50, default seed bid setting\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show running-config | include sgbp\nsgbp group test_group\r\n\r\nIf your device displays output similar to either of the above examples,  please consult the IOS software table below to determine whether your version  of IOS is affected.",

				"text": "Multilink PPP (MLP) allows users to combine multiple PPP links into a  single logical network connection, thus enabling on demand bandwidth  allocation. When implemented across multiple device chassis, this is known as  Multichassis Multilink PPP (MMP). The Stack Group Bidding Protocol is the  mechanism by which devices participating in MMP locate each other and negotiate  for a connection termination point.\r\n\r\nThe SGBP implementation provided by the Cisco Internetwork Operating  System (IOS) is susceptible to a denial of service attack when presented with a  crafted UDP packet. Sending such a packet to port 9900 of an affected device  will cause it to freeze and stop responding to or passing traffic. After a  delay, the system watchdog timer will detect this condition and force a reset  of the device. The system recovery behavior will be controlled by the device  configuration register; for example, the router may reload or drop to the ROM  monitor.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID  CSCsb11124 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsb11124\"]            ( registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)         .",

				"text": "This section describes workarounds for these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n   Configure Access Control Lists (ACLs)\r\nFor sites that require the SGBP protocol to be enabled, it may be possible to apply Access Control Lists (ACLs) to prevent untrusted hosts from exploiting this vulnerability. The following extended access-list can be adapted to your network. This example assumes that the SGBP members communicate using the 192.168.10.0 network.\r\naccess-list 101 permit udp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 port eq 9900 \naccess-list 101 deny udp any 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 port eq 9900  access-list 101 permit ip any any\r\n    The access-list must then be applied to all interfaces using configuration commands such as:\r\ninterface ethernet 0/0 \nip access-group 101 in\r\n\r\n   Enable Control Plane Policing\r\nThe Control Plane Policy (CoPP) feature may be used to mitigate this vulnerability, as in this example:\r\n! Do not police SGBP traffic from the trusted network \naccess-list 140 deny udp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 9900  ! Police SGBP traffic from untrusted hosts and networks  access-list 140 permit udp any any eq 9900  ! Do not police any other type of traffic going to the router  access-list 140 deny ip any any  !  class-map match-all sgbp-class  match access-group 140  !  policy-map control-plane-policy  ! Drop all traffic that matches the class \"sgbp-class\" class sgbp-class  drop  !  control-plane  service-policy input control-plane-policy\r\n\r\n Note: CoPP is only available on certain platforms and IOS release trains.   Additional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be   found at the following URL:\r\n      http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html\"]\r\n\r\n   Infrastructure ACLs (iACL)\r\nAlthough it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your network, it is possible to identify traffic which should never be allowed to target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of your network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a network security best practice and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The white paper entitled \"Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists\" presents guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for iACLs: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html [\"/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"]\r\n\r\n   Configuring Receive Access Lists (rACLs)\r\nFor distributed platforms, rACLs may be an option starting in Cisco IOS Software Versions 12.0(21)S2 for the 12000 series GSR and 12.0(24)S for the 7500 series. The receive access lists protect the device from harmful traffic before the traffic can impact the route processor. Receive path ACLs are considered a network security best practice, and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security, as well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The CPU load is distributed to the line card processors and helps mitigate load on the main route processor. The white paper entitled \"GSR: Receive Access Control Lists\" will help identify and allow legitimate traffic to your device and deny all unwanted packets: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/racl.html [\"/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml\"]",

For  further details, please refer to the software table below.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, also consult  http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt [\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"]  and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade  solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the  devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and  software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new  release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical  Assistance Center (\"TAC\") or your contracted maintenance provider for  assistance.\r\n\r\nEach row of the Cisco IOS software table (below) describes a release  train and the platforms or products for which it is intended.

Police SGBP traffic from untrusted hosts and networks  access-list 140 permit udp any any eq 9900  ! Do not police any other type of traffic going to the router  access-list 140 deny ip any any  !  class-map match-all sgbp-class  match access-group 140  !  policy-map control-plane-policy  ! Drop all traffic that matches the class \"sgbp-class\" class sgbp-class  drop  !  control-plane  service-policy input control-plane-policy\r\n\r\n Note: CoPP is only available on certain platforms and IOS release trains.   Additional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be   found at the following URL:\r\n      http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html\"]\r\n\r\n   Infrastructure ACLs (iACL)\r\nAlthough it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your network, it is possible to identify traffic which should never be allowed to target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of your network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a network security best practice and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The white paper entitled \"Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists\" presents guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for iACLs: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html [\"/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"]\r\n\r\n   Configuring Receive Access Lists (rACLs)\r\nFor distributed platforms, rACLs may be an option starting in Cisco IOS Software Versions 12.0(21)S2 for the 12000 series GSR and 12.0(24)S for the 7500 series. The receive access lists protect the device from harmful traffic before the traffic can impact the route processor. Receive path ACLs are considered a network security best practice, and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security, as well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The CPU load is distributed to the line card processors and helps mitigate load on the main route processor. The white paper entitled \"GSR: Receive Access Control Lists\" will help identify and allow legitimate traffic to your device and deny all unwanted packets: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/racl.html [\"/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml\"]"
