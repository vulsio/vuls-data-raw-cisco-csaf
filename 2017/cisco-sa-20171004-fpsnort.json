				"text": "A vulnerability in the detection engine parsing of IPv6 packets for Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization or to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition because the Snort process restarts unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the fields in the IPv6 extension header packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious IPv6 packet to the detection engine on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped. This vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic only.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171004-fpsnort [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171004-fpsnort\"]",

The dashboard displays a list of file action policies that are configured for the system.\r\nClick the Report icon next to a policy to see details about the current saved configuration for the policy.\r\n\r\nEach file action policy specifies a set of rules and actions that defines how to handle files that meet specific criteria. If one or more policies specify a Block Files, Block Malware, or Detect Files action, the system is vulnerable.",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:\r\n\r\ncisco-sa-20171004-fpsnort [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171004-fpsnort\"]: Cisco Firepower Detection Engine IPv6 Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-20171004-ftd [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171004-ftd\"]: Cisco Firepower Detection Engine SSL Decryption Memory Consumption Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco software. The center column indicates whether a major release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first minor release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a major release is affected by all the vulnerabilities described in this collection of advisories and the current recommended release for those vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n                                Cisco Firepower System Software                             First Fixed Release for              This Vulnerability                              Recommended Release for              This Vulnerability and All Vulnerabilities Described in the Collection of Advisories                                                 Prior to 6.0\r\n              Not vulnerable\r\n              N/A\r\n                                  6.0.1\r\n              6.0.1.4 (future release)\r\n              6.2.0.2\r\n                                  6.1.0              6.1.0.3              6.1.0.6 (future release) or 6.2.0.2                                   6.2.0              6.2.0.2              6.2.0.3                                   6.2.1              Vulnerable; migrate to 6.2.2\r\n              6.2.2                                  6.2.2              Not vulnerable\r\n              6.2.2\r\nTo upgrade the Firepower System Software, use one of the following methods:\r\n\r\nWhen using Firepower Management Center (FMC) to upgrade the software, customers should install the fixed release of the software and reapply the access control policy after the installation. The Snort version installed is dependent on the FMC software release.\r\nWhen using Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) or Firepower Device Manager (FDM) to upgrade the software, customers should upgrade to the fixed release of the software and reapply the access control policy after the installation.",
