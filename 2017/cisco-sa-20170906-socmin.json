An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the administrator of an affected system to import a crafted XML file with malicious entries, which could allow the attacker to read and write files and execute remote code within the application.\r\n\r\nAdditional information about XXE attacks and potential mitigations can be found at: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing [\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing\"]\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170906-socmin [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170906-socmin\"]",
