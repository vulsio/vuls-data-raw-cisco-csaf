An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing SNMP polling on MIBs and using only Interface Index (ifIndex) values. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to increase CPU usage to 99% on an affected device and cause a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170201-asrsnmp[\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170201-asrsnmp\"]",

If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS XE Software or similar text.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.17.01.S:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software, Version 03.17.01.S - Standard Support Release\r\nCisco IOS Software, ASR903 Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-UNIVERSALK9_NPE-M), Version 15.6(1)S1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Wed 09-Mar-16 06:34 by mcpre\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nFor information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html\"].\n",
