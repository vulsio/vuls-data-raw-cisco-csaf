				"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities exist in Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) and WebEx Recording Format (WRF) files. A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a malicious ARF or WRF file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an affected player to crash and, in some cases, could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded by an online meeting attendee. The player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server.\r\n\r\nCisco has updated affected versions of the Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, and Cisco WebEx ARF and WRF Players to address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-webex-players [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-webex-players\"]",

The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30, WBS 31, and WBS32), Cisco WebEx Meetings, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server are affected by at least one of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\r\n\r\nCisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30) client builds prior to T30.20\r\nCisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds prior to T31.20\r\nCisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS32) client builds prior to T32.7\r\nCisco WebEx Meetings with client builds prior to T32.7\r\nCisco WebEx Meeting Server builds prior to 2.7MR3\r\n  To determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support > Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under About Meeting Center. See the “Fixed Software” section for details.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, version information of the Cisco WebEx meeting client can be accessed from within the Cisco WebEx meeting client. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Windows and Linux platforms can be viewed by choosing Help > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Mac platforms can be viewed by choosing Meeting Center > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 30.32.16 is fixed, build 30.32.17 will contain updated software. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, for example, T30 SP32 EP 16, which shows that the server is running client build 30.32.16.\r\n\r\nNote: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.",

The Cisco WebEx Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customer can host in their private clouds.\r\n\r\nThe ARF and WRF file formats are used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site, or on the computer of an online meeting attendee.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx ARF Player and the Cisco WebEx WRF Player are applications that are used to play back and edit WebEx ARF and WRF recording files (files with .arf and .wrf extensions).\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx ARF Player and Cisco WebEx WRF Player can be automatically installed when a user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for streaming playback mode). The Cisco WebEx ARF Player and Cisco WebEx WRF Player can also be manually installed after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"] to play back recording files for offline playback.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx ARF Player is available for all Cisco WebEx meeting site clients (WBS30, WBS31, WBS32, and WebEx Meetings) and for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server clients. The Cisco WebEx WRF Player is only available for Cisco WebEx WBS30, WBS 31, and WBS32 meeting site clients and is not available for the Cisco WebEx Meetings or Cisco WebEx Meetings Server clients.\r\n\r\nThe following table provides the Cisco bug IDs and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers that have been assigned for the vulnerabilities in this advisory:\r\n\r\n                              Title              CVE ID              Cisco Bug ID                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Denial of Service Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12367              CSCve11545, CSCve02843, CSCve11548\r\n                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12368              CSCve10584, CSCve10591, CSCve11503, CSCve10658, CSCve11507, CSCve10749, CSCve10744, CSCve11532, CSCve10762, CSCve10764, CSCve11538                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Out-of-Bounds Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12369              CSCve30208, CSCve30214, CSCve30268                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12370              CSCvf38060, CSCvg54836, CSCvf38077, CSCvg54843, CSCvf38084, CSCvg54850                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12371              CSCvf49650, CSCvg54853, CSCvg54856, CSCvf49697, CSCvg54861, CSCvf49707, CSCvg54867                                  Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player Remote Code Execution Vulnerability               CVE-2017-12372              CSCvf57234, CSCvg54868, CSCvg54870\r\nExploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause player applications to crash or, in some cases, execute malicious code from a remote attacker.\r\n\r\nTo exploit these vulnerabilities, the player application would need to open a malicious ARF or WRF file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file directly to users (for example, by using email), or by directing a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities cannot be triggered by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nThe following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30, WBS31, WBS32), Cisco WebEx Meetings, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server address all the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS30) client builds T30.20 and later\r\nCisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS31) client builds T31.20 and later\r\nCisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS32) client builds T32.7 and later\r\nCisco WebEx Meetings with client builds T32.7 and later\r\nCisco WebEx Meeting Server builds 2.7MR3 and later, 2.8MR1 and later, 3.0 and later\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support > Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under About Meeting Center. The Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 30.32.16 is fixed, build 30.32.17 will contain updated software.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx ARF and WRF Players. The Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the players are all affected by at least one vulnerability described in this advisory. If the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, non-vulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"https://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"].\r\n\r\nUsers can manually verify the installed version of the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco
