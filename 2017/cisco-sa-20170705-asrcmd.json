				"text": "A vulnerability in the CLI command-parsing code of the Cisco StarOS operating system for Cisco ASR 5000 Series, 5500 Series, and 5700 Series devices and Cisco Virtualized Packet Core (VPC) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to break from the StarOS CLI of an affected system and execute arbitrary shell commands as a Linux root user on the system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected operating system does not sufficiently sanitize commands before inserting them into Linux shell commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CLI command for execution in a Linux shell command as a root user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to break from the StarOS CLI and execute arbitrary commands on the affected system as a Linux root user.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170705-asrcmd [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170705-asrcmd\"]",

The following example shows the output of the command for a Cisco ASR 5500 Series Router that is running Cisco StarOS Release 19.2.1:\r\n\r\n\r\n[local]ASR-2# show version\r\n\r\nFriday August 12 13:17:31 AST 2016\r\nActive Software:\r\n  Image Version:                  19.2.1\r\n  Image Build Number:             62564\r\n  Image Description:              Deployment_Build\r\n  Image Date:                     Thu Dec 31 20:13:39 EST 2015\r\n  Boot Image:                     /flash/asr5500-19.2.1.bin\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco StarOS is running on a VPC-SI or VPC-DI instance, administrators can issue the show version command in the device CLI.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate fixed release as indicated in the applicable table in this section.\r\n\r\nCisco ASR 5000 Series, 5500 Series, and 5700 Series Devices\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the first column lists major releases of the Cisco StarOS operating system.
