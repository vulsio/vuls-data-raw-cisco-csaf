				"text": "On October 16, 2017, a research paper with the title “Key Reinstallation Attacks: Forcing Nonce Reuse in WPA2” was made publicly available. This paper discusses seven vulnerabilities affecting session key negotiation in both the Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and the Wi-Fi Protected Access II (WPA2) protocols. These vulnerabilities may allow the reinstallation of a pairwise transient key, a group key, or an integrity key on either a wireless client or a wireless access point. Additional research also led to the discovery of three additional vulnerabilities (not discussed in the original paper) affecting wireless supplicant supporting either the 802.11z (Extensions to Direct-Link Setup) standard or the 802.11v (Wireless Network Management) standard. The three additional vulnerabilities could also allow the reinstallation of a pairwise key, group key, or integrity group key.\r\n\r\nAmong these ten vulnerabilities, only one (CVE-2017-13082) may affect components of the wireless infrastructure (for example, Access Points), while the other nine vulnerabilities may affect only client devices.\r\n\r\nMultiple Cisco wireless products are affected by these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nCisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that addresses the vulnerabilities in CVE-2017-13077, CVE-2017-13078, CVE-2017-13079, CVE-2017-13080, CVE-2017-13081, and CVE-2017-13082. There are no workarounds for CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, and CVE-2017-13088.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171016-wpa [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171016-wpa\"]",

The Software Version field shows the release number of the software currently running on the device.\r\n\r\nTo use the CLI, issue the show sysinfo command, and then refer to the value in the Product Version field of the command output. The following example shows the output of the command for a device running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.3.102.0:\r\n\r\n(5500-4) >show sysinfo\r\nManufacturer's Name..............................

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passively eavesdropping on a TDLS handshake and retransmitting previously used message exchanges between supplicant and authenticator.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-13086\r\n\r\nGroup key (GTK) reinstallation when processing a Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the processing of the 802.11v (Wireless Network Management) Sleep Mode Response frames could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to force a supplicant that is compliant with the 802.11v standard to reinstall a previously used group key.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to ambiguities in the processing of associated protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passively eavesdropping and retransmitting previously used WNM Sleep Mode Response frames.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-13087\r\n\r\nIntegrity group key (IGTK) reinstallation when processing a Wireless Network Management (WNM) Sleep Mode Response frame\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the processing of the 802.11v (Wireless Network Management) Sleep Mode Response frames could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to force a supplicant that is compliant with the 802.11v standard to reinstall a previously used integrity group key.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to ambiguities in the processing of associated protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passively eavesdropping and retransmitting previously used WNM Sleep Mode Response frames.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2017-13088\r\n\r\nNote: Fixes should be installed on both affected access points and wireless clients for a complete solution. Installing a fixed software release on an affected access point will fix that particular device, but will not prevent exploitation of any vulnerabilities affecting a wireless client. The converse is also true: installing a fix on a wireless client would fix that particular device, but would not prevent exploitation of any vulnerabilities affecting an access point.

Setting the EAPoL retries value to 0 means one message will be sent, there will be no retransmissions sent, and if the EAPoL timeout is exceeded the client will be removed.\r\n\r\nThis workaround can be configured at the global level or at the individual wireless LAN (WLAN) level. Please note that the option to configure this workaround at the WLAN level is only available on Cisco WLC releases 7.6 and later. Previous releases only allow configuration at the global (all WLANs) level.\r\n\r\nIn order to configure this workaround at the global level (for all WLANs), use the following command in the WLC CLI:\r\nconfig advanced eap eapol-key-retries 0\r\n\r\n    The command show advanced eap can be used to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):\r\n\r\n(wlc-hostname)> show advanced eap\r\nEAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)........... 30  EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries................. 2  EAP Key-Index for Dynamic WEP.................... 0  EAP Max-Login Ignore Identity Response........... enable  EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).................... 30  EAP-Request Max Retries.......................... 2  EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)................. 1000  EAPOL-Key Max Retries............................ 0  EAP-Broadcast Key Interval....................... 120\r\n\r\nIn order to configure this workaround for a specific WLAN, the following two commands should be entered in the WLC CLI:\r\nconfig wlan security eap-params enable WLAN-NUMBER\r\nconfig wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 WLAN-NUMBER\r\n    Both commands must be entered and WLAN-NUMBER should be replaced with the actual WLAN number. In the following example, the workaround is being implemented on WLAN number 24:\r\nconfig wlan security eap-params enable 24\r\nconfig wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 24\r\n\r\nThe command show wlan WLAN-NUMBER (where WLAN-NUMBER is replaced with the appropriate WLAN number) can be used then to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):\r\n(wlc-hostname)> show wlan 24\r\nWLAN Identifier.................................. X  Profile Name..................................... ftpsk  Network Name (SSID).............................. ftpsk  .  .  .    Tkip MIC Countermeasure Hold-down Timer....... 60    Eap-params....................................

This is seen on some embedded/CPU-limited clients, which may receive the M1 and not be ready to process it after the 802.1x  authentication phase.\r\nEnvironments with RF (Radio Frequency) interference or a WAN connection between the access point (AP) and the WLC, which may result in packet drops at some point on transmission towards clients.\r\n  In either scenario the outcome would be an EAPoL exchange failure and the wireless client will lose its authentication, requiring it to restart the association/authentication processes.\r\nWorkaround for CVE-2017-13082  For customers who are concerned about CVE-2017-13082 (Accepting a Retransmitted FT Reassociation Request and Reinstalling the Pairwise Key While Processing It), the workaround is as follows:\r\n\r\nIf no interactive applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video are being used on the network, you can disable 11r support on the access point.\r\nIf VoIP applications are in use but the supplicants support CCKM (for example, Cisco Wireless Phones), you can disable 11r support and reconfigure the clients to use CCKM (Cisco Centralized Key Management), which should provide a similar roaming experience.\r\n  Note: Disabling 11r support may have negative performance and availability impact on the network. Customers should verify that disabling 11r would not negatively impact their environment before performing such configuration change on their infrastructure devices.\r\n\r\nNo workarounds have been identified for CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, or CVE-2017-13088.

This is seen on some embedded/CPU-limited clients, which may receive the M1 and not be ready to process it after the 802.1x  authentication phase.\r\nEnvironments with RF (Radio Frequency) interference or a WAN connection between the access point (AP) and the WLC, which may result in packet drops at some point on transmission towards clients.\r\n  In either scenario the outcome would be an EAPoL exchange failure and the wireless client will lose its authentication, requiring it to restart the association/authentication processes.\r\nWorkaround for CVE-2017-13082  For customers who are concerned about CVE-2017-13082 (Accepting a Retransmitted FT Reassociation Request and Reinstalling the Pairwise Key While Processing It), the workaround is as follows:\r\n\r\nIf no interactive applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video are being used on the network, you can disable 11r support on the access point.\r\nIf VoIP applications are in use but the supplicants support CCKM (for example, Cisco Wireless Phones), you can disable 11r support and reconfigure the clients to use CCKM (Cisco Centralized Key Management), which should provide a similar roaming experience.\r\n  Note: Disabling 11r support may have negative performance and availability impact on the network. Customers should verify that disabling 11r would not negatively impact their environment before performing such configuration change on their infrastructure devices.\r\n\r\nNo workarounds have been identified for CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, or CVE-2017-13088.

Setting the EAPoL retries value to 0 means one message will be sent, there will be no retransmissions sent, and if the EAPoL timeout is exceeded the client will be removed.\r\n\r\nThis workaround can be configured at the global level or at the individual wireless LAN (WLAN) level. Please note that the option to configure this workaround at the WLAN level is only available on Cisco WLC releases 7.6 and later. Previous releases only allow configuration at the global (all WLANs) level.\r\n\r\nIn order to configure this workaround at the global level (for all WLANs), use the following command in the WLC CLI:\r\nconfig advanced eap eapol-key-retries 0\r\n\r\n    The command show advanced eap can be used to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):\r\n\r\n(wlc-hostname)> show advanced eap\r\nEAP-Identity-Request Timeout (seconds)........... 30  EAP-Identity-Request Max Retries................. 2  EAP Key-Index for Dynamic WEP.................... 0  EAP Max-Login Ignore Identity Response........... enable  EAP-Request Timeout (seconds).................... 30  EAP-Request Max Retries.......................... 2  EAPOL-Key Timeout (milliseconds)................. 1000  EAPOL-Key Max Retries............................ 0  EAP-Broadcast Key Interval....................... 120\r\n\r\nIn order to configure this workaround for a specific WLAN, the following two commands should be entered in the WLC CLI:\r\nconfig wlan security eap-params enable WLAN-NUMBER\r\nconfig wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 WLAN-NUMBER\r\n    Both commands must be entered and WLAN-NUMBER should be replaced with the actual WLAN number. In the following example, the workaround is being implemented on WLAN number 24:\r\nconfig wlan security eap-params enable 24\r\nconfig wlan security eap-params eapol-key-retries 0 24\r\n\r\nThe command show wlan WLAN-NUMBER (where WLAN-NUMBER is replaced with the appropriate WLAN number) can be used then to verify the configuration change is now active on the device (in bold on the following example output):\r\n(wlc-hostname)> show wlan 24\r\nWLAN Identifier.................................. X  Profile Name..................................... ftpsk  Network Name (SSID).............................. ftpsk  .  .  .    Tkip MIC Countermeasure Hold-down Timer....... 60    Eap-params....................................

This is seen on some embedded/CPU-limited clients, which may receive the M1 and not be ready to process it after the 802.1x  authentication phase.\r\nEnvironments with RF (Radio Frequency) interference or a WAN connection between the access point (AP) and the WLC, which may result in packet drops at some point on transmission towards clients.\r\n  In either scenario the outcome would be an EAPoL exchange failure and the wireless client will lose its authentication, requiring it to restart the association/authentication processes.\r\nWorkaround for CVE-2017-13082  For customers who are concerned about CVE-2017-13082 (Accepting a Retransmitted FT Reassociation Request and Reinstalling the Pairwise Key While Processing It), the workaround is as follows:\r\n\r\nIf no interactive applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or video are being used on the network, you can disable 11r support on the access point.\r\nIf VoIP applications are in use but the supplicants support CCKM (for example, Cisco Wireless Phones), you can disable 11r support and reconfigure the clients to use CCKM (Cisco Centralized Key Management), which should provide a similar roaming experience.\r\n  Note: Disabling 11r support may have negative performance and availability impact on the network. Customers should verify that disabling 11r would not negatively impact their environment before performing such configuration change on their infrastructure devices.\r\n\r\nNo workarounds have been identified for CVE-2017-13086, CVE-2017-13087, or CVE-2017-13088. Any future workarounds that address these vulnerabilities will be documented in the respective Cisco bugs, which are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/BUGID\"]."
