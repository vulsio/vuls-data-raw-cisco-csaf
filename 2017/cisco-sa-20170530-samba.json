In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nTo determine the affected and fixed releases for each vulnerable  product, refer to the Cisco bug identified for the product.
