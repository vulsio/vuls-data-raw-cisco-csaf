In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n  Cisco UCS Central Software Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Central Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the web-based management interface of the affected software.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information on the user’s system.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials for and authenticate to the affected software.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability cannot be exploited to run persistent scripts in the web-based management interface of the affected software and, therefore, cannot be leveraged to affect users other than the targeted user.\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12348\r\n\r\nThe Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium\r\n  Cisco UCS Central Software Session Fixation Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the session management functionality of the web-based management interface of Cisco UCS Central Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to hijack a valid session ID from a user of the web-based management interface of the affected software.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software does not assign a new session ID to a user session when a user authenticates to the software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a hijacked session ID to connect to the affected software through the web-based management interface of the software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to hijack an authenticated user’s browser session.\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2017-12349\r\n\r\nThe SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium",
