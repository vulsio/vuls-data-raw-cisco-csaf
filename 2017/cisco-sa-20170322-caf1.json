An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted requests to the CAF web interface. The impacts of a successful exploit are limited to the scope of the virtual instance and do not impact the router that is hosting Cisco IOx.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170322-caf1 [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170322-caf1\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nCisco IOx Release 1.2.4.2 resolves this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco IR800 Series Platforms\r\n\r\nCisco IOx Release 1.2.4.2 can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] by navigating to Products > Routers > Industrial Routers > 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers > 809 Industrial Integrated Services Routers > IOx Fog Node Software-1.2.0.\r\n\r\nThis release of Cisco IOx is also included in the Cisco IOS bundle image, which can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] by navigating to Products > Routers > Industrial Routers > 800 Series Industrial Integrated Services Routers > 809 Industrial Integrated Services Routers > IOS Software-15.6.3M1b.\r\n\r\nCisco ISR4K and ASR1K Series Platforms\r\n\r\nCisco IOx Release 1.2.4.2 is included in Cisco IOS XE Everest Release 16.4.1.\r\n\r\nISR4K: Cisco IOS XE Everest Release 16.4.1 can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] by navigating to Products > Routers > Branch Routers > 4000 Series Integrated Services Routers > [specific product] > IOS XE Software-Everest-16.4.1(ED).\r\n\r\nASR1K: Cisco IOS XE Everest Release 16.4.1 can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] by navigating to Products > Routers > Service Provider Edge Routers > ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers > [specific product] > IOS XE Software-Everest-16.4.1(ED).",
