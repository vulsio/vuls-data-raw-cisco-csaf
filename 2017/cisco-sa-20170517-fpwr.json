An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of crafted TCP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition. The success of an exploit is dependent on how an administrator has configured logging for SSL policies for a device.\r\n\r\nThere are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170517-fpwr [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170517-fpwr\"]",
