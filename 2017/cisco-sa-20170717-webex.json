				"text": "A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx browser extensions for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser on an affected system. This vulnerability affects the browser extensions for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, Cisco WebEx Centers (Meeting Center, Event Center, Training Center, and Support Center), and Cisco WebEx Meetings when they are running on Microsoft Windows.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a design defect in the extension. An attacker who can convince an affected user to visit an attacker-controlled web page or follow an attacker-supplied link with an affected browser could exploit the vulnerability. If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected browser.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170717-webex [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170717-webex\"]",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nTo resolve the vulnerability, users must ensure that they have updated versions of the following:\r\nCisco WebEx extensions for Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox\r\nCisco WebEx Desktop Applications\r\nFor the latest information about fixes for the following products, consult the appropriate Cisco bug ID:\r\nCisco WebEx Meeting Center: CSCvf15012 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvf15012\"]\r\nCisco WebEx Event Center: CSCvf15036 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvf15036\"]\r\nCisco WebEx Training Center: CSCvf15033 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvf15033\"]\r\nCisco WebEx Support Center: CSCvf15037 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvf15037\"]\r\nCisco WebEx Meetings Server: CSCvf15020 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvf15020\"]\r\nCisco WebEx Meetings: CSCvf15030 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvf15030\"]\r\n  Browser Updates\r\nThe following subsections provide instructions for updating the Cisco WebEx browser extensions. Customers can allow their browsers to auto-update by launching the browser and keeping the browser window open for 3-6 hours, during which time the extensions will be auto-updated.\r\n\r\nNote: Should the browser window close before the auto-update check completes, the timer will reset, requiring a browser window to be launched at a later time and remain open for 3-6 hours to receive the update.\r\n\r\nGoogle Chrome\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx extension for Google Chrome version 1.0.12 was released on July 13, 2017, and contains a fix for this vulnerability. Chrome users can ensure they are using the fixed version of the Cisco WebEx extension for Google Chrome by doing the following:\r\n\r\nIn Chrome, click the menu button (three dots at the upper right of the application) and choose More Tools > Extensions.\r\nCheck the Developer mode check box at the top of the extensions manager. Chrome will display a row of buttons.\r\nClick the Update extensions now button.\r\n\r\nRestart the Chrome browser.\r\nMozilla Firefox\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx extension for Mozilla Firefox version 1.0.12 was released on July 12, 2017, and contains a fix for this vulnerability. Firefox users can ensure they are using the fixed version of the Cisco WebEx extension for Mozilla Firefox by doing the following:\r\n\r\nIn Firefox, click the menu button (three horizontal bars at the upper right of the application) and choose Add-ons\r\nClick the Extensions tab\r\nLocate Cisco WebEx Extension in the list of extensions and click the More link to obtain the version information\r\nClick the cogwheel next to the search bar and choose Check for Updates\r\nMicrosoft Internet Explorer\r\n\r\nBecause there are shared components between the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox extensions and Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer users will be prompted to update Cisco WebEx plug-ins. The plug-ins are available as part of the Cisco WebEx client packages associated with each WebEx product, and will be available to download after a WebEx site has been upgraded to a fixed version. Upgraded clients are available from the Downloads section of each site after an upgrade has been performed. Users that connect to an upgraded site without the updated client software may be prompted to perform an online upgrade.\r\n\r\nCustomers may check that the browser plug-in upgrade was successful by using the following procedures for Microsoft Internet Explorer:\r\n\r\nNote: The registered name of the plug-in in Internet Explorer may differ based on the installation method used for the plug-in. The version of the plug-in depends on the version of Cisco WebEx that provided the update. The update may have been applied either via the web when joining a WebEx meeting or by a local update of the client via an MSI file. When a fixed version of the plug-in from any version of Cisco WebEx is installed, it will not be downgraded or changed to a version installed by a different fixed version of Cisco WebEx. Internet Explorer users can ensure they are using the fixed version of the plug-in for Internet Explorer by doing the following:\r\n\r\nIn Internet Explorer, click the Tools button (the cog icon at the upper right of the application) and choose Manage add-ons.\r\nFrom the Show drop-down menu, choose All add-ons.\r\nSelect either the Download Manager or GpcContainer Class add-on under Cisco WebEx LLC. The version number is displayed at the bottom of the Manage add-ons window.\r\n\r\nValidate that the Download Manager version or GpcContainer Class version displayed is one of the version strings in the following table:\r\n                              Cisco WebEx Major Version              Fixed GPC Container or Download Manager Version                                   32.3.4.5               10032.3.2017.711                                   31.14.3.30               10031.14.2017.711                                   31.11.11               10031.11.2017.0713                                   30.20.3.10012               10030.100.2017.0711                                   30.9.3               10030.100.2017.0713                                   30.6.7               10030.100.2017.0713\r\n\r\nValidating Cisco WebEx Desktop Application Product Upgrades\r\n\r\nCisco has released fixes for all major versions for Cisco WebEx Desktop Application for use with following products:\r\n\r\nCisco WebEx Meeting Center\r\nCisco WebEx Event Center\r\nCisco WebEx Training Center\r\nCisco WebEx Support Center\r\nCisco WebEx Meetings\r\n                              Cisco WebEx Major Version              Fixed Desktop Application Version                                    WBS32               32.3.4.5                                   WBS31               31.14.3, 31.11.11\r\n                                   WBS30               30.20.3, 30.9.3, 30.6.7\r\n\r\nNote: There are no fixes available for WBS29.\r\n\r\nCurrent WebEx customers can confirm that their site has received updated software by reviewing the Application Version information in the Support section of their WebEx page. Perform the following steps to view this information:\r\n\r\nSign in to your WebEx account\r\nClick the Meeting Center tab\r\nUnder Support, click Downloads\r\nThe Application Version is displayed on the right side of the screen under the About Meeting Center heading\r\nIf you have not automatically received the update, please contact Cisco Support or a Cisco partner.\r\n\r\nNote: The clients for all licensed features of a Cisco WebEx product must be upgraded to ensure compatibility with the deployed site application version. Upgrading a single client will resolve the vulnerability documented by CVE-2017-6753. The following clients are available:\r\n\r\nCisco WebEx Meeting Center Client\r\nCisco WebEx Event Center Client\r\nCisco WebEx Training Center Client\r\nCisco WebEx Support Center Client\r\nCisco WebEx Access Anywhere Client\r\nCisco WebEx Remote Access Client\r\nCisco WebEx Meetings\r\n\r\nCisco has released a fix for Cisco WebEx Meetings.
