The attacker must authenticate with valid administrator credentials.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input on the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and performing command injection over the web interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges from administrator to root.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170719-wsa1 [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170719-wsa1\"]",

For additional information about affected and fixed software releases, see the Fixed Software [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170920-wsa#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the version command in the WSA CLI. The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 10.1.0-204:\r\nciscowsa> version\r\n  Current Version  ===============  Product: Cisco S370 Web Security Appliance  Model: S370  Version: 10.1.0-204  Build Date: 2016-12-21  .  .  .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile logged in to the web GUI, administrators can view the Current AsyncOS Version under System Administration > System Upgrade.",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:\r\n\r\n                              Cisco AsyncOS for Web Software Major Release              First Fixed Release                                  Prior to 10.0              Not affected                                  10.0\r\n              Affected; migrate to 10.1.1-235                                  10.1              10.1.1-235                                  10.5              10.5.1-270                                  11.0              Affected; migrate to the upcoming 11.5 release\r\nIn most cases, Cisco WSA can be updated over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the System Administration GUI. Perform the following steps to upgrade a device by using the System Administration GUI:\r\n\r\nChoose System Administration > System Upgrade.\r\nClick Upgrade Options.\r\nChoose Download and Install.\r\nChoose the release to upgrade to.\r\nIn the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.\r\nClick Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.\r\n  After the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.",
