An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting a malicious packet and sending it through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170515-snort [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170515-snort\"]",
