An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly sending unauthenticated gRPC requests to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the device in such a manner that manual intervention is required to recover.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170503-ios-xr [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170503-ios-xr\"]",

If the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software, Cisco IOS XR Software or similar text appears in the system banner. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the location of the system image file.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.2.5:\r\n\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:ios#show version\r\nWed Jun 15 16:08:37.966 UTC\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XR Software, Version 5.2.5\r\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\n\r\nBuild Information:\r\n Built By     : ahoang\r\n Built On     : Thu Mar 17 19:26:37 PDT 2016\r\n Build Host   : iox-lnx-006\r\n Workspace    : /auto/srcarchive16/production/5.2.5/all/workspace\r\n Version      : 5.2.5\r\n Location     : /opt/cisco/XR/packages/\r\n\r\ncisco NCS-6000 () processor\r\nSystem uptime is 6 weeks, 6 days, 19 hours, 32 minutes",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been corrected in Cisco IOS XR Software Releases 6.1.2 and later.\r\n\r\nNote that Cisco IOS XR Software Releases 5.x and 6.0.x are not affected by this vulnerability.",
