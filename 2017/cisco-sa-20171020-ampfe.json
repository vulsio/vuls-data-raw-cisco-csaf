An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining local, administrative access to a Windows host and stopping the Cisco AMP for Endpoints service.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds that address this vulnerability are available.  This advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171020-ampfe [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171020-ampfe\"]",
