				"text": "A vulnerability in the Plug-and-Play (PnP) subsystem of the Cisco Aironet 1800, 2800, and 3800 Series Access Points running a Lightweight Access Point (AP) or Mobility Express image could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of PnP server responses.  The PnP feature is only active while the device does not contain a configuration, such as a first time boot or after a factory reset has been issued.  An attacker with the ability to respond to PnP configuration requests from the affected device can exploit the vulnerability by returning malicious PnP responses.  If a Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller - Enterprise Module (APIC-EM) is available on the network, the attacker would need to exploit the issue in the short window before a valid PnP response was received. If successful, the attacker could gain the ability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system of the device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170503-cme [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170503-cme\"]",

The following example shows the output of the command for a device running software version 8.3.102.0:\r\n\r\nAP# show version\r\n.\r\n.\r\ncisco AIR-AP3802E-B-K9 ARMv7 Processor rev 1 (v7l) with 1030528/668540K bytes of memory.\r\nProcessor board ID RFDPP1BS497\r\nAP Running Image     : 8.3.102.0\r\nPrimary Boot Image   : 8.3.102.0\r\n.\r\n.",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n                                Cisco Aironet 1800, 2800, 3800 Access Points              First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability                                                 Prior to 8.0              Not vulnerable\r\n                                  8.0              Not vulnerable\r\n                                  8.1              Not vulnerable\r\n                                  8.2              Not vulnerable\r\n                                  8.3              8.3.112.0 (See Note)\r\n                                  8.4              Not vulnerable\r\n\r\nNote - Version 8.3.111.0 is the first fixed version, but was deferred and replaced by 8.3.112.0.",
