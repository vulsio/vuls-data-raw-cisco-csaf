An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specific, known commands after authenticating locally to the system via the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view confidential information that should only be visible to authenticated users.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
