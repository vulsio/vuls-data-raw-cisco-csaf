				"text": "A vulnerability in the Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol implementation in Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition when an FCoE-related process unexpectedly reloads.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of proper FCoE frame padding validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted FCoE frames to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition, which would impact FCoE traffic passing through the device. The attacker's server must be directly connected to the FCoE interface on the device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170607-nxos [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170607-nxos\"]",
