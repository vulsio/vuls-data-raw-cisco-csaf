				"text": "A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Firepower Management Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability occurs because the affected software fails to perform sufficient validation and sanitization of user-supplied input when processing crafted URLs. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site and allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170215-fpmc[\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170215-fpmc\"]",
