An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted fragmented IP traffic across the CX module. An exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust free packet buffers in shared memory (SHM), causing the CX module to be unable to process further traffic, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\n\n\nCisco has not released and will not release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\n\n\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170125-cas[\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170125-cas\"]",
