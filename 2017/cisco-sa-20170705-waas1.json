				"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Central Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve completed reports from an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a processing error in how the affected software applies role-based access control (RBAC) to URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a brute-force attack or guessing the report ID of a completed report and sending a crafted HTTP GET request with the ID to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download any completed report that was previously scheduled by a WAAS administrator via the Reports Central area in the WAAS Central Manager GUI of the affected system.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
