The attacker must first authenticate to the application with valid administrator credentials.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input at the CLI for certain commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected application and submitting a crafted CLI command for execution at the Cisco Meeting Server CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform command injection and escalate their privilege level to root.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170823-cms [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170823-cms\"]",

An administrator can determine the software version by using the version command. In this example, the following command output shows the version of a device running software version 2.0.6:\r\nsystem> version\r\n2_0_6",
