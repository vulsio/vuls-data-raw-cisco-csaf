The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of sensitive data when responding to an HTTP request on the web interface. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the application to access specific system files. An exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information about the application which could include user credentials.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170517-pcp2 [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170517-pcp2\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:\r\n\r\ncisco-sa-20170517-pcp1 [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170517-pcp1\"]: Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-20170517-pcp2 [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170517-pcp2\"]: Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Prime Collaboration Provisioning Software Release 11.6 and 12.1 and later.
