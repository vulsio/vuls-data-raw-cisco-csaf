An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and providing crafted user input at the CLI, using this script file to escalate their privilege level and execute commands as root. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to acquire root-level privileges and take full control of the appliance. The user has to be logged-in to the device with valid credentials for a specific set of users.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170517-cps [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170517-cps\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nThis vulnerable is fixed in software versions and 11.1.0, 12.0.0 and 12.1.0.
