An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Create Request packet to an affected device. An exploit could allow an attacker to cause a process to reload unexpectedly and cause a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
