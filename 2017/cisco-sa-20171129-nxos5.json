An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to escape the scripting sandbox and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the authenticated user.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access and be authenticated to the targeted device with administrative or tclsh execution privileges.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-nxos5 [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-nxos5\"]",
