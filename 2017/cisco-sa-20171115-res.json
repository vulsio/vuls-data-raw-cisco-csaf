				"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web interface of the Cisco Registered Envelope Service could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or redirect a user of the affected service to an undesired web page.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected service. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user  to click a malicious link or by sending an HTTP request that could cause the affected service to redirect the request to a specified malicious URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to  execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web interface of the affected system or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information on the affected system. These types of exploits could also be used in phishing attacks that send users to malicious websites without their knowledge.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nFor additional information about cross-site scripting attacks and the methods used to exploit these vulnerabilities, see the following resources:\r\n\r\nCisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin: Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Threat Vectors [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20060922-understanding-xss\"]\r\nOWASP reference: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)\"]\r\nCWE definition: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation [\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html\"]\r\nCWE definition: CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site [\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html \"]\r\n  This advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171115-res [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171115-res\"]",
