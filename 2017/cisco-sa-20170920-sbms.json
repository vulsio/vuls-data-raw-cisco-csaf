An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected switch via SSH and sending a malicious SSH message.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170920-sbms [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170920-sbms\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\n                                Cisco Product\r\n              First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability\r\n                                              Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches\r\n              1.4.8.06\r\n                                  Small Business 500 Series Stackable Managed Switches\r\n                                  ESW2 Series Advanced Switches\r\n                                  350 Series Managed Switches\r\n              2.3.0.130\r\n\r\n                                  350X Series Stackable Managed Switches\r\n                                  550X Series Stackable Managed Switches\r\n\r\nThe software can be downloaded from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com by navigating to Downloads Home > Products > Switches > LAN Switches - Small Business and selecting the respective model.",
