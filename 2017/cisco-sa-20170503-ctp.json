				"text": "A vulnerability in the ICMP ingress packet processing of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the TelePresence endpoint to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation for the size of a received ICMP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted ICMP packet to the local IP address of the targeted endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS of the TelePresence endpoint, during which time calls could be dropped. This vulnerability would affect either IPv4 or IPv6 ICMP traffic.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170503-ctp [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170503-ctp\"]",

After logging in to the web interface, the welcome text displays information about the software release that is running on the device.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following welcome text appears for a Cisco TelePresence Magnus SX80 codec that is running software release CE 8.2.0:\r\nWelcome to Magnus SX80\r\nCisco Codec Release ce 8.2.0 PreAlpha1 c6612ca 2016-04-25\r\nSW Release Date: 2016-04-25 14:58:45, matchbox",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n  This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software release 8.3.2  or later. The Cisco TelePresence software can be downloaded from the Download Software [\"http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html\"] site by navigating to Products > Video > Cisco TelePresence.\r\n\r\nNote: The Spark Room OS software upgrade is controlled by Cisco, and customer endpoints will be updated in the cloud.",
