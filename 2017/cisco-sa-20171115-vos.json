				"text": "A vulnerability in the upgrade mechanism of Cisco collaboration products based on the Cisco Voice Operating System software platform could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized, elevated access to an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability occurs when a refresh upgrade or Prime Collaboration Deployment (PCD) migration is performed on an affected device. When a refresh upgrade or PCD migration is completed successfully, an engineering flag remains enabled and could allow root access to the device with a known password.\r\n\r\nIf the vulnerable device is subsequently upgraded using the standard upgrade method to an Engineering Special Release, service update, or a new major release of the affected product, this vulnerability is remediated by that action.\r\n\r\nNote: Engineering Special Releases that are installed as COP files, as opposed to the standard upgrade method, do not remediate this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAn attacker who can access an affected device over SFTP while it is in a vulnerable state could gain root access to the device. This access could allow the attacker to compromise the affected system completely.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171115-vos [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171115-vos\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Voice Operating System (VOS)–based products when they have been upgraded by using the refresh upgrade (RU) method or migrated by using the Prime Collaboration Deployment (PCD) method:\r\n\r\nCisco Unified Communications Manager (UCM)\r\nCisco Unified Communication Manager Session Management Edition (SME)\r\nCisco Emergency Responder\r\nCisco Unity Connection\r\nCisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service (IM&P; earlier releases were known as Cisco Unified Presence)\r\nCisco Prime License Manager\r\nCisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment\r\nCisco Unified Contact Center Express (UCCx)\r\nCisco SocialMiner\r\nCisco Unified Intelligence Center (UIC)\r\nCisco Finesse\r\nCisco MediaSense\r\n  The PCD migration method affects only Cisco UCM, SME, and IM&P.\r\nDetermining the Upgrade or Migration Method  The Cisco VOS-based products identified in the preceding vulnerable products list are affected by this vulnerability if they were refresh upgraded or migrated by using the PCD methods. Note that a VOS-based product must go through a refresh upgrade if the underlying operating system is also being upgraded to a new major release.\r\n\r\nIf the VOS-based product was standard upgraded to an Engineering Special, service update, or a new major release of the affected product that does not require major upgrades to the underlying operating system, this vulnerability will be remediated by that standard upgrade action.\r\n\r\nRefresh Upgrade Method Verification\r\n\r\nTo verify whether the product has been exposed to the vulnerability by the refresh upgrade method, issue the following command at the CLI to view the system-history.log file:\r\nadmin: file view install system-history.log\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a refresh upgrade entry in the system-history.log file:\r\n02/28/2013 14:56:05 | root: Upgrade (refresh) 10.0.0.97016-27 Success\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a standard upgrade entry in the system-history.log file:\r\n10/13/2017 18:56:07 | root: Upgrade 12.0.1.20000-3 Success\r\n\r\nPCD Migration Method Verification\r\n\r\nTo verify whether the product has been exposed to this vulnerability by the PCD migration method, issue the following command at the CLI to view the install.log file:\r\nadmin: file view install install.log\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a PCD migration log entry in the install.log file:\r\n10/16/2017 13:59:13 post_install|Starting post_install processing - VOS_INSTALL_CONTEXT = M1|\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a normal fresh install log entry in the install.log file:\r\n08/15/2011 08:56:03 post_install|Starting post_install processing - VOS_INSTALL_CONTEXT = install|\r\n\r\nUnderlying Operating System Upgraded to a New Major Release\r\n\r\nA VOS-based product will undergo a refresh upgrade if the underlying operating system is also upgraded to a new major release.\r\n\r\nThe following examples show major operating system releases that are associated with major affected product releases:\r\n\r\n                              Cisco  UCM, Cisco Unity Connection, and Cisco Unified Presence Server/Cisco IM&P  Major Release              Operating System Major Release                                  8.6              RHEL 5 Update 5                                  9.x              RHEL 5 Update 7                                  10.x              RHEL 6 Update 2                                  11.x              RHEL 6 Update 5                                  12.x              CentOS 6 Update 6\r\nBecause an upgrade from RHEL 6 to CentOS 6 is not considered a major operating system release change, product updates between these operating system releases will use the standard upgrade method.\r\n\r\nPrime Collaboration Deployment Cluster Migration\r\n\r\nPrime Collaboration Deployment is a free application that is designed to assist in the management of various Cisco Unified Communications applications. The PCD migrate cluster task is supported only for the following Cisco products and to only certain cluster migration destination versions.\r\n\r\nUCM destination version 10.x, 11.0(1), 11.5(x), 12.0(1)\r\nIM&P destination version 10.x, 11.0(1), 11.5(x), 12.0(1)\r\nRefer to the product documentation for information about specific upgrade and migration methods.  Determining the Current Software Release for the Cisco Unified Platform  The following Cisco products run on the Cisco Unified platform:\r\n\r\nUnified Communications Manager\r\nUnified Communications Manager Session Management Edition\r\nEmergency Responder\r\nUnity Connection\r\nUnified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service\r\nPrime License Manager\r\nHosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment\r\nTo determine which Cisco VOS-based product software release is running on the Cisco Unified platform, an administrator can issue the show version active command at the CLI.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the software release is 11.5.1.10000-86.\r\nciscocm: show version active\r\nActive Master Version: 11.5.1.10000-86\r\n\r\nAn administrator can use the user interface to determine which Cisco VOS-based product software release is running:\r\n\r\nLog in to the web-based interface\r\nClick the Help menu\r\nClick About to view the system software release\r\nDetermining the Current Software Release for the Cisco Contact Center Platform  The following Cisco products run on the Cisco Contact Center platform:\r\nUnified Contact Center Express\r\nSocialMiner\r\nUnified Intelligence Center\r\nFinesse\r\nMediaSense\r\nTo determine which Cisco VOS-based product software release is running on the Contact Center platform, an administrator can issue the show version active command at the CLI.\r\n\r\nIn the following example, the software release is 11.5.1.10000-86.\r\nadmin: show version active\r\nActive Master Version: 11.5.1.10000-86\r\n\r\nAn administrator can use the user interface to determine which Cisco Contact Center platform–based product software release is running:\r\n\r\nLog in to the Contact Center Express server\r\nGo to the Cisco Unified Communications operating system administration window\r\nChoose Show > Software",
