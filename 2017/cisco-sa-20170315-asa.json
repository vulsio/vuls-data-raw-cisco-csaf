An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending TCP or UDP packets with a destination port of 3784 or 3785 through the ASA.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds that address this vulnerability are available.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170315-asa [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170315-asa\"]",
