An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted association request. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the switch to restart.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170927-ios-xe [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170927-ios-xe\"]",

For information about which Cisco IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS XE Software or similar text.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.16.1aS:\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software, Version 03.16.01a.S - Extended Support Release\r\nCisco IOS Software, ASR1000 Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.5(3)S1a, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Wed 04-Nov-15 17:40 by mcpre\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nFor information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html\"].\r\n  To determine if the device is acting as a WLC, administrators can log in to the device and use the show wireless interface summary command in the CLI, and then refer to the command output that appears. If the device is acting as a WLC, the output will display configured interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show wireless interface summary command on a device with one wireless interface configured:\r\n\r\n3850-4# show wireless interface summary\r\nWireless Interface Summary\r\n\r\nInterface Name Interface Type VLAN ID IP Address      IP Netmask     MAC Address\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nVlan151        Management     151     192.168.151.14  255.255.255.0  d0c7.8956.b24d",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n  Customers should upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Software version 16.3.5.\r\n\r\nThe software updates can be downloaded from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com.",
