				"text": "A vulnerability in a proprietary device driver in the kernel of Cisco TelePresence Multipoint Control Unit (MCU) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper size validation when reassembling fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv4 or IPv6 fragments to a port receiving content in Passthrough content mode. An exploit could allow the attacker to overflow a buffer. If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary code or cause a DoS condition on the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170125-telepresence [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170125-telepresence\"]",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nIn the following table the left column lists major releases of Cisco TelePresence Software. The right column indicates whether a major release  is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the  first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:\r\n                                Cisco TelePresence Software Major Release\r\n              First Fixed Release\r\n                                              4.2 and earlier\r\n              Not affected\r\n                                  4.31\r\n              Affected; migrate to 4.5(1.89)\r\n                                  4.4\r\n              Affected; migrate to 4.5(1.89)\r\n                                  4.5              Affected; migrate to 4.5(1.89)\r\n\r\n1 Passthrough content mode was only introduced in version 4.3(1.68). TelePresence Software 4.3 releases prior to 4.3(1.68) are not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNote: There will be no fix for the TelePresence MCU 4500 platform as  that platform has reached the end-of-software maintenance milestone on  July 9, 2016:\r\nEnd-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco TelePresence MCU 4500 Series [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/conferencing/telepresence-mcu-4500-series/eos-eol-notice-c51-733654.html\"]",
