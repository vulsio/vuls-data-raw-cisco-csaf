In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-34710: Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter Software Command Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco ATA 190 Series Multiplatform Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack resulting in remote code execution. It could also allow a lower-privileged user to run commands as an administrative user.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web UI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject commands that will be executed on the underlying OS with root privileges. A lower-privileged user could also potentially run commands with the privileges of an administrative user within the web UI.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx48193 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx48193\"]\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-34735: Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapter Software Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in ICMP packet processing of Cisco ATA 190 Series On-Premises Software and ATA 190 Series Multiplatform Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Ethernet IP interface to become unreachable, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to lack of proper rate limiting of ICMP packets on the Ethernet interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted, steady stream of ICMP traffic to the IP address of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Ethernet port to go offline which leads to a DoS condition. The user could observe the PRT LED on the ATA device turning red, the ATA becoming unresponsive over the web management interface and the Ethernet port no longer having an IP address association. This will require a manual power-cycle to recover the device.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw25739 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw25739\"], CSCvw22570 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw22570\"], CSCvw25740 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCCSCvw25740\"]\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.6\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H",
