An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to an affected IP camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected IP camera to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nNote: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
