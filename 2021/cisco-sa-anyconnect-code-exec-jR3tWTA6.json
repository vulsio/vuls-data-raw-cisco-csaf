In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows Uninstall Executable Hijacking Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the uninstall process of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform an executable hijacking attack on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because a temporary file with insecure permissions is created during the uninstall process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by overwriting the temporary file before it is accessed for execution. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by copying a malicious DLL file to a specific directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with SYSTEM privileges. To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw16996, CSCvw17005\r\nCVE ID(s): CVE-2021-1427, CVE-2021-1428\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.0\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows Upgrade Executable Hijacking Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the install process of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform an executable hijacking attack on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because a temporary file with insecure permissions is created during the upgrade process.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n   Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists the CVE identifiers for the vulnerabilities that are addressed in this advisory.
