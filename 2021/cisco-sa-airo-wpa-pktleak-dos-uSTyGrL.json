				"text": "A vulnerability in the WLAN Control Protocol (WCP) implementation for Cisco Aironet Access Point (AP) software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect error handling when an affected device receives an unexpected 802.11 frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain 802.11 frames over the wireless network to an interface on an affected AP. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a packet buffer leak. This could eventually result in buffer allocation failures, which would trigger a reload of the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nThe process to upgrade an AP requires administrators to upgrade the wireless controller to which the AP is registered. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table(s):\r\n\r\nAccess Points Managed by Wireless LAN Controller or Mobility Express\r\n\r\n        Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Release  First Fixed Release          8.9 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      8.10  8.10.162.01\r\n1. The first vulnerable release is Release 8.10.121.0.\r\nAccess Points Managed by Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controller or Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC) on Catalyst Access Points\r\n        Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controller Software Release  First Fixed Release          16.12 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      17.2  Migrate to a fixed release.1      17.3  IOS XE Access Point Service Pack 17.03.04.CSCvz178682      17.4 and later  Not vulnerable.\r\n1. The first vulnerable release is Release 17.2.1.\r\n2. The first fixed release for this vulnerability is Release 17.3.4. However, in order to fix this vulnerability and CSCvz08781 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz08781\"], the recommendation is to upgrade to Release 17.3.4 and install the IOS XE Access Point Service Pack 17.03.04.CSCvz17868.",
