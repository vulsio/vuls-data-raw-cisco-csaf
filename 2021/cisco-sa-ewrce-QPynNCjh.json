An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the system as an administrative user and then uploading specific crafted software images to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the root user.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nWhile the following mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.\r\n  Firewall Rule Modifications\r\nAccess to the management plane of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS should be restricted to trusted networks. Administrators can restrict access to the management ports (HTTPS/SSH) within the firewall rules on the device or by using an external firewall. The web UI port numbers can also be modified in the configuration.\r\n\r\nAs a best practice, access to the management plane of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS should not be exposed to the internet. For additional information, see the Intrusion Protection [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_749C6B6E7566A37934C9AD39ED91E612\"] section of the Cisco Expressway Administrator Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html\"].\r\n  Dedicated Management Interface\r\nAs a best practice, access to the management plane of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS should not be exposed to the internet. Beginning with Release X12.7, the product introduced a Dedicated Management Interface (DMI). Administrators can enable the DMI and implement the following configuration:\r\n\r\nAllow the DMI to be the only interface used for management\r\nConfigure the DMI to be accessed only from trusted segments\r\n\r\nFor additional information, see Configuring the Dedicated Management Interface (DMI) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_network-and-system-settings.html#reference_5EB4447A6E9556705392D8970EC2EA50\"] section of the Cisco Expressway Administrator Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html\"].\r\n  Client Certificate-Based Security\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited only by an authenticated administrator. Using client authentication certificates helps prevent brute forcing of the administrative passwords. For additional information, see the Configuring Certificate-Based Authentication [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html#reference_BCD936F444AADC9C4311E0B1820A89AD\"] section of the Cisco Expressway Administrator Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/expressway/admin_guide/X14-0/exwy_b_cisco-expressway-administrator-guide/exwy_m_managing-security.html\"].",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nAt the time of publication, Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS Release X14.0.3 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nFor information about fixed software releases, see the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.",
