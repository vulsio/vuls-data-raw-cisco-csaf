An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying an ISO image and then either installing that image as an administrator or placing that image on a file server, which an unsuspecting administrator could then use when upgrading the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx38902 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx38902\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-34708\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.0\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-34709: Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco 8000 and Network Convergence System 540 Series Routers Image Verification Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in image verification checks of Cisco NCS 540 Series Routers, only when running Cisco IOS XR NCS540L software images, and Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco 8000 Series Routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a race condition that occurs when the install request is being processed, which may allow another authenticated administrator to alter the certificate used to validate whether the installation image has a certificate that is not issued by Cisco. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying an ISO image and then either installing that image as an administrator or placing that image on a file server, which an unsuspecting administrator could then use when upgrading the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.\r\n\r\nNote: During the installation process, the attacker would need to beat the race condition to change the validated certificate.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx53064 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx53064\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-34709\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.0\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N",
