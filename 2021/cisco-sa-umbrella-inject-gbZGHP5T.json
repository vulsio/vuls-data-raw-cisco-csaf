In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1474: Cisco Umbrella CSV Formula Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Admin audit log export feature of Cisco Umbrella could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a formula injection attack on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of formula elements in the comma-separated value (CSV) file that is generated by the Admin audit log export feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing certain actions that would lead to an injection of malicious entries into the log. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject malicious formula elements into the CSV file. These elements would be executed when a user opens the CSV file with a spreadsheet application, which could lead to manipulation of the data in the CSV file or code execution on the computer of the user.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx27753 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx27753\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1474\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1475: Cisco Umbrella Link Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Scheduled Reports feature of Cisco Umbrella could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a link injection attack on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by scheduling a report with a crafted title. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject a malicious link into the report, leading the user to believe that the link is coming from the application.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx28555 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx28555\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1475\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N",
