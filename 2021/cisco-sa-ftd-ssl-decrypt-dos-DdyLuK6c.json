				"text": "A vulnerability in the software-based SSL/TLS message handler of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of SSL/TLS messages when the device performs software-based SSL decryption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL/TLS message through an affected device. SSL/TLS messages sent to an affected device do not trigger this vulnerability. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a process to crash. This crash would then trigger a reload of the device. No manual intervention is needed to recover the device after the reload.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the April 2021 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: April 2021 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74594\"].",

The following example shows the output of the show ssl-policy-config command on a device that does not have an SSL policy configured and is not vulnerable:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show ssl-policy-config\r\nSSL policy not yet applied.\r\n\r\nAny other output returned by the show ssl-policy-config command indicates that an SSL policy is configured and the device is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the show ssl-policy-config command, see the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Command Reference [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense/s_8.html#wp8230585640\"].\r\n\r\nOption 2: Use the GUI\r\n\r\nTo determine whether an SSL decryption policy is enabled on a device, check the appropriate policy:\r\n\r\nFor devices managed by Firepower Management Center (FMC) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/660/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v66/getting_started_with_ssl_policies.html#ID-2253-00000021\"]:\r\nPolicies > Access Control > SSL\r\nFor devices managed by Firepower Device Manager (FDM) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/660/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-660/fptd-fdm-ssl-decryption.html#task_A46EB67387764C209439122818AB7B43\"]:\r\nPolicies > SSL Decryption",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by any of the vulnerabilities described in this bundle and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nFTD Software\r\n        Cisco FTD Software Release   First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability  Recommended Fixed Release for All Vulnerabilities Described in the Bundle of Advisories          Earlier than 6.2.21  Not vulnerable.  Migrate to a fixed release.      6.2.2  Not vulnerable.  Migrate to a fixed release.      6.2.3  Not vulnerable.  Migrate to a fixed release.      6.3.0  Migrate to a fixed release.  Migrate to a fixed release.      6.4.0  Not vulnerable.  6.4.0.12 (May 2021)      6.5.0  Not vulnerable.  Migrate to a fixed release.      6.6.0  Not vulnerable.  6.6.42      6.7.0  Not vulnerable.  6.7.0.2\r\n1.

Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n2. The First Fixed Release for the 6.6.0 code train was 6.6.3; however, due to upgrade issues associated with CSCvx86231 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx86231\"] the recommended release is 6.6.4.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco FTD Software, customers can do one of the following:\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), use the FMC interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), use the FDM interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.",
