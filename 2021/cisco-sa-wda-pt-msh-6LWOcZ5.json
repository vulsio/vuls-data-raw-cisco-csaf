				"text": "A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App and Webex Productivity Tools for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain access to sensitive information on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the unsafe usage of shared memory by the affected software. An attacker with permissions to view system memory could exploit this vulnerability by running an application on the local system that is designed to read shared memory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the shared memory, including usernames, meeting information, or authentication tokens.\r\n\r\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid credentials on a Microsoft Windows end-user system and must log in after another user has already authenticated with Webex on the same end-user system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wda-pt-msh-6LWOcZ5 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wda-pt-msh-6LWOcZ5\"]",

A popup window displaying the currently installed release will open. This is also documented in the article Check the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App Version [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/0usc4ab\"].\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco Webex Productivity Tools is installed on a Windows machine, right-click the Webex Productivity Tools icon on the Windows taskbar and select About from the menu.

With the Cisco Webex Meetings desktop app, you can start and join meetings without going to your Webex site.\r\n\r\nCisco Webex Productivity Tools is an optional companion application that allows users to quickly schedule and join meetings from their desktop without the need to access the Meetings website. The application should not be confused with the Cisco Webex Meetings Client, which is the main client application that provides the core functionality to host or attend a Webex meeting.\r\n\r\nAdministrators can update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App or Webex Productivity Tools for their user base by following the instructions available in the document IT Administrator Guide for Mass Deployment of the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App and Productivity Tools [\"https://help.webex.com/en-us/51k9lo/IT-Administrator-Guide-for-Mass-Deployment-of-Cisco-Webex-Meetings-Desktop-app-and-Productivity-Tools-WBS39-10-and-Later\"].\r\n\r\nUsers can update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App by launching the Cisco Webex Meetings application and clicking the gear icon in the top right of the application window and then choosing the Check for Updates entry from the drop-down list. This is also documented in the article Update the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/n1kwkd6\"].\r\n\r\nUsers can update the Cisco Webex Productivity Tools in Microsoft Outlook by selecting Schedule Meeting > More > Check for Updates.
