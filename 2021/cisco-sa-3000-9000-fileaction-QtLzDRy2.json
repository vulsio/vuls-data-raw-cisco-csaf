				"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of an internal file management service for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode that are running Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create, delete, or overwrite arbitrary files with root privileges on the device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because TCP port 9075 is incorrectly configured to listen and respond to external connection requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP packets to an IP address that is configured on a local interface on TCP port 9075. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create, delete, or overwrite arbitrary files, including sensitive files that are related to the device configuration. For example, the attacker could add a user account without the device administrator knowing.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the February 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: February 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74414\"].",

Customers are advised to explicitly deny all TCP packets that are destined to a locally configured IP address with a destination port of 9075 as part of their iACLs. A customized control plane policing (CoPP) policy may also be used to drop all TCP port 9075 traffic that is destined to an affected device.\r\n\r\nCustomers are advised to first evaluate the impact of configuration changes to the device and their security policy. Customers who are concerned about undesired or unexpected side effects are advised to contact their support organization before implementing  configuration changes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, local exploitation of this vulnerability is possible if the NX-OS features bash or guestshell are enabled. There is no workaround or mitigation for a local attacker with valid device credentials; however, customers are advised to follow best practices for account management as outlined in the Cisco Guide to Securing NX-OS Software Devices - Use Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/securing_nx_os.html#_Toc303633186\"].",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Cisco NX-OS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software, platform, and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release���for example, 7.0(3)I7(5) for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or 14.0(1h) for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:\r\n    Cisco NX-OS Software  Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode    MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches  Nexus 1000V Series Switches  Nexus 3000 Series Switches  Nexus 5000 Series Switches  Nexus 6000 Series Switches  Nexus 7000 Series Switches  Nexus 9000 Series Switches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.\r\n\r\nCisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches SMUs\r\n\r\nFor Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches, SMUs are available for Cisco NX-OS Software releases 9.3(5) and 9.3(6). Customers can download the following SMUs from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home\"] on Cisco.com:\r\n\r\nnxos.CSCvw89875-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-9.3.5.lib32_n9000.rpm\r\nnxos.CSCvw89875-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-9.3.6.lib32_n9000.rpm\r\n\r\nFor details about downloading and installing SMUs in Cisco NX-OS Software for these Cisco Nexus Switches, see the Performing Software Maintenance Upgrades section of the appropriate NX-OS system management configuration guide:\r\n\r\nCisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/system_mgmt/7_x/b_Cisco_Nexus_3000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide_7x/b_Cisco_Nexus_3000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide_7x_chapter_010011.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/system_management/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide_7x/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide_7x_chapter_010100.html\"]\r\n  Additional Resources\r\nFor help determining the best Cisco NX-OS Software release for a Cisco Nexus Switch, see the following Recommended Releases documents.

Customers are advised to explicitly deny all TCP packets that are destined to a locally configured IP address with a destination port of 9075 as part of their iACLs. A customized control plane policing (CoPP) policy may also be used to drop all TCP port 9075 traffic that is destined to an affected device.\r\n\r\nCustomers are advised to first evaluate the impact of configuration changes to the device and their security policy. Customers who are concerned about undesired or unexpected side effects are advised to contact their support organization before implementing  configuration changes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, local exploitation of this vulnerability is possible if the NX-OS features bash or guestshell are enabled. There is no workaround or mitigation for a local attacker with valid device credentials; however, customers are advised to follow best practices for account management as outlined in the Cisco Guide to Securing NX-OS Software Devices - Use Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/securing_nx_os.html#_Toc303633186\"].",
