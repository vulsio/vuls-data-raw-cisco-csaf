An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious LLDP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected device or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released firmware updates that address these vulnerabilities.

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious LLDP packet to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read of the valid LLDP packet data, which could allow the attacker to cause corruption in the internal LLDP database of the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released firmware updates that address these vulnerabilities.
