In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1136: Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco 8000 Series Routers and Network Convergence System 540 Series Routers GRUB Boot Loader Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the GRUB boot loader of Cisco NCS 540 Series Routers, only when running Cisco IOS XR NCS540L software images, and Cisco IOS XR Software for the Cisco 8000 Series Routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute unsigned code during the boot process on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an unlocked version of GRUB boot loader on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying the boot process from the GRUB menu. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the boot chain of trust.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvs70887 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvs70887\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1136\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\"]\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1244: Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco 8000 Series Routers and Network Convergence System 540 Series Routers Unsigned Boot File Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the signing functions of ISO packaging of Cisco NCS 540 Series Routers, only when running Cisco IOS XR NCS540L software images, and Cisco IOS XR Software for the Cisco 8000 Series Routers could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrator privileges to execute unsigned code during the installation of an ISO on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an unsigned script within the ISO that is not verified during system upgrade before it is executed. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could modify an ISO image and then either use that image to upgrade as an authenticated administrator or place that image on a file server, which an unsuspecting administrator could then use when upgrading the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvr07463 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr07463\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1244\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nThe following table shows the first fixed release for each CVE ID:\r\n        Affected Platform  First Fixed Release for CVE-2021-1136 (CSCvs70887)  First Fixed Release for CVE-2021-1244 (CSCvr07463)          Cisco 8000 Series Routers  7.0.12\r\n7.2.1  7.0.14\r\n7.2.1      Cisco NCS 540 Series Routers  7.2.1  7.1.2\r\n7.2.1",
