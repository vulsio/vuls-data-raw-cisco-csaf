				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) Launcher could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a user's operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of proper signature verification for specific code exchanged between the ASDM and the Launcher. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a man-in-the-middle position on the network to intercept the traffic between the Launcher and the ASDM and then inject arbitrary code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's operating system with the level of privileges assigned to the ASDM Launcher. A successful exploit may require the attacker to perform a social engineering attack to persuade the user to initiate communication from the Launcher to the ASDM.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asdm-rce-gqjShXW [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asdm-rce-gqjShXW\"]",

Customers are advised to do the following:\r\n\r\nChoose No to end the connection.\r\nVerify that the value in the Device IP Address / Name field of the Cisco ASDM-IDM Launcher does indeed correspond to a known device that is running Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco ASDM Software in their network.\r\nLog in to the listed device through the CLI and use the show version | include Device Manager command to determine the configured Cisco ASDM release.\r\n\r\nIf this output reports a Cisco ASDM release earlier than Release 7.18.1.152, then the warning message is legitimate and an attack less likely. Cisco still recommends that customers upgrade to Cisco ASDM Release 7.18.1.152 or later to get the fix for this vulnerability. Upgrading would also prevent this warning message in future connection attempts.\r\n\r\nIf this output reports Cisco ASDM Release 7.18.1.152 or later, then an ongoing attack is likely and should be further investigated.",
