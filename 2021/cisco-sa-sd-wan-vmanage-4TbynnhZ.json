In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the vulnerabilities below only impact Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software that is operating in a cluster. Customers can verify whether the software is operating in cluster mode by checking the Cisco SD-WAN vManage web-based management interface Administration > Cluster Management view. Customers should also refer to the Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide chapter on Cluster Management [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/manage-cluster.html\"].\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1468: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Cluster Mode Unauthorized Message Processing Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in a messaging service of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software when operating in cluster mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send unauthorized messages to the vulnerable application.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper authentication checks on user-supplied input to an application messaging service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to call privileged actions within the affected system, including creating new administrative level user accounts.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvu28454 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu28454\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1468\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1505: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Cluster Mode Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software when operating in cluster mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization checking and gain elevated privileges within an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform authorization checks on certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authorization checks and gain elevated privileges within the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvu28390 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu28390\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1505\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1508: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Cluster Mode Unauthorized Access Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software when operating in cluster mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization checking and make application modifications that could allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges within an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform authorization checks on certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authorization checks and gain elevated privileges within the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large amount of API requests to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvv67264 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv67264\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1275\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1506: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Cluster Mode Unauthorized Services Access Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in a service of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software when operating in cluster mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to services within an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform authorization checks on service access.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table(s).
