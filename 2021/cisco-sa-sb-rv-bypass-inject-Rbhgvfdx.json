An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the underlying OS.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\nRV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router\r\nRV340W Dual WAN Gigabit Wireless-AC VPN Router\r\nRV345 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router\r\nRV345P Dual WAN Gigabit PoE VPN Router\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw92538 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw92538\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1473\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1472: Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Authentication Bypass File Upload Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and upload files to directories that should require administrative authentication.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper session management on affected devices. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload files to directories that should have been restricted. It should be noted that the files are uploaded to temporary directories, and the files should be deleted.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
