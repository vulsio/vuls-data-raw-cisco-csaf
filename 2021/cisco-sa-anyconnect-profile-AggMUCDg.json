An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPC message to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify VPN profile files. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
