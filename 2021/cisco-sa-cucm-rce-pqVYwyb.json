An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a SOAP API request with crafted parameters to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying Linux operating system of the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n   Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following tables, the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in this section.\r\n\r\nUnified CM and Unified CM SME: CSCvu56491 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu56491\"]\r\n    Cisco Unified CM and Unified CM SME Releases First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability     10.5(2) None planned   11.0(1) Migrate to 11.5(1)SU9   11.5(1) 11.5(1)SU9   12.0(1) Migrate to 12.5(1)SU4   12.5(1) 12.5(1)SU4\r\n Unified CM IM&P: CSCvv41616 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv41616\"]\r\n    Cisco Unified CM IM&P Releases First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability     10.5(2) None planned   11.0(1) Migrate to 11.5(1)SU9   11.5(1) 11.5(1)SU9   12.0(1) Migrate to 12.5(1)SU4   12.5(1) 12.5(1)SU4\r\n Unity Connection: CSCvv35203 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv35203\"]\r\n    Cisco Unity Connection Releases First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability     10.5(2) None planned   11.0(1) Migrate to 11.5(1)SU9   11.5(1) 11.5(1)SU9   12.0(1) Migrate to 12.5(1)SU4   12.5(1) 12.5(1)SU4\r\nPrime License Manager: CSCvv59434 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv59434\"]\r\n    Cisco Prime License Manager Releases First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability     10.5(2) None planned   11.0(1) Migrate to 11.5(1)SU9   11.5(1) 11.5(1)SU9",
