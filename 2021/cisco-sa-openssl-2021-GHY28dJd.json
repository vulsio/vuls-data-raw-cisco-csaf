				"text": "OpenSSL Certificate Validation Vulnerability\r\nOpenSSL contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to use a valid non-certificate authority (CA) certificate to act as a CA and sign a certificate for an arbitrary organization, user, or device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a bypassed check in the validation logic of X.509 certificate chains, resulting in the affected system accepting as valid certificates signed by a non-CA certificate or certificate chain. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using any valid certificate or certificate chain to sign a crafted certificate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct a main-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack and obtain sensitive information (or misreport information) or impersonate an organization, user, or device. Exploitation of this vulnerability could also allow attackers to access networks or assets that are protected by certificate authentication.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-3450\r\n  OpenSSL NULL Pointer Dereference Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nOpenSSL contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software incorrectly handles memory structures, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by submitting crafted Transport Layer Security (TLS) packets to an interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the TLS server process which could result in a DoS condition on the targeted device.\r\n\r\nNote: Only servers that are processing incoming TLSv1.2 packets are affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-3449",
