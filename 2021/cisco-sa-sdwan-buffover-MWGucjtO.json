In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1509: Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the vDaemon process in Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when an affected device processes traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic to an affected device. The attacker must have a man-in-the-middle position between Cisco vManage and an associated device that is running an affected version of Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct a controllable buffer overflow attack and possibly execute arbitrary commands as the root user, or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvt11545 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvt11545\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1509\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1510: Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the packet mirroring feature of Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reboot, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking when an affected device processes traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table(s).
