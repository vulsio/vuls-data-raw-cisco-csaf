To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have a valid account on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of command line arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering a crafted command at the prompt. A successful exploit could allow an attacker with low-level privileges to escalate their privilege level to root.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
