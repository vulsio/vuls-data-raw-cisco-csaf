An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content of the configuration database and gain root-level access to an affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 2021 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2021 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

				"text": "At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software and had the SD-WAN feature enabled:\r\n\r\n1000 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISRs)\r\n4000 Series ISRs\r\nASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers (ASRs)\r\nCloud Services Router (CSR) 1000V Series\r\n\r\nNote: The SD-WAN feature is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n    Determine the Device Configuration\r\nThere are two methods for determining whether the SD-WAN feature is enabled on a device:\r\n\r\nOption 1: Use the show running-config | include sdwan Command\r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine whether sdwan mode is enabled on a device, use the show running-config | include sdwan command and check the tunnel mode in the output. If the command returns tunnel mode sdwan, the sdwan feature is enabled and the device is vulnerable. If the command returns no output or the command does not exist, the SD-WAN feature is not enabled and the device is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show running-config | include sdwan command on a device that has the SD-WAN feature enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config | include sdwan\r\ntunnel mode sdwan\r\nRouter#\r\n\r\nOption 2: Use the show version Command\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, use the show version command to determine whether the Cisco IOS XE device is in Controller mode. The end of the output includes the router operating mode, which indicates whether the device is in Controller mode.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows part of the show version command output on a device that has the SD-WAN feature enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show version\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nRouter operating mode: Controller-Managed\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n        Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release—for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.",
