An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authorization and connect to other vManage tenants that they are not authorized to connect to.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the web-based management interface and using the SSH console feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information, which would allow them to carry out further attacks.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvs11283 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvs11283\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1304\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1305: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Authorization Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access information such as logs, configurations, and device information that they are not authorized to view.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks of user account privileges. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the web-based management interface with a low-privileged user account.

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table(s).
