In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1393: Cisco Application Services Engine Unauthorized Service Access Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in Cisco Application Services Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a privileged service on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for a service running in the Data Network. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP requests to a specific service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to have privileged access to run containers or invoke host-level operations.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw14124 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw14124\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1393\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1396: Cisco Application Services Engine Unauthorized API Access Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in Cisco Application Services Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker access to a specific API on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for an API running in the Data Network. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to learn device-specific information, create tech support files in an isolated volume, and make limited configuration changes.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw55819 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw55819\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1396\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco Application Services Engine Networks\r\n\r\nCisco Application Services Engine is deployed as a cluster, connecting each service node to two networks:\r\n\r\nManagement Network using management interfaces. (mgmt0, mgmt1)\r\nData Network using the fabric interfaces. (fabric0, fabric1)\r\n\r\nManagement Network provides the following services:\r\n\r\nAccessing the Cisco Application Services Engine GUI.\r\nAccessing the CLI over SSH.\r\nDNS and NTP.\r\nFirmware uploads.\r\nInterSight device connector.\r\n\r\nData Network provides the following services:\r\n\r\nCisco Application Services Engine Clustering.\r\nApp to app communication.\r\nAccess to the management network of the Cisco ACI fabric.\r\nAll app to ACI fabric communications.",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table:\r\n        Cisco Application Services Engine Software Release  First Fixed Release for These Vulnerabilities          1.1  1.1(3e)      2.0  Not vulnerable",
