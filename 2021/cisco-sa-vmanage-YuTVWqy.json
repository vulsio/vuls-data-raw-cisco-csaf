In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1479: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Remote Management Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in a remote management component of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to the vulnerable component. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted connection request to the vulnerable component that, when processed, could cause a buffer overflow condition. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system with root privileges.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvv87918 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv87918\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1479\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1137: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the user management function of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the affected software. An authenticated attacker who has permissions to add new users or groups on the vManage system could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a user account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw08533 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw08533\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1137\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1480: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in system file transfer functions of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain escalated privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of input to the system file transfer functions. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the vulnerable system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files and modify the system in such a way that could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table.\r\n        Cisco SD-WAN vManage Release  First Fixed Release  First Fixed Release for all Vulnerabilities in this Advisory          18.4 and earlier  Migrate to a fixed release.
