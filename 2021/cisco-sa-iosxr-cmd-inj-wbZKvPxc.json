In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-34721: Cisco IOS XR Software Command Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the XML configuration manager of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges on the underlying Linux operating system (OS) of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of commands that are supplied by a user. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to a device and submitting crafted input to affected commands. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain access to the underlying root shell of the affected device and execute arbitrary commands as root.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx48002 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx48002\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-34721\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-34722: Cisco IOS XR Software Command Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain access to the root shell of an affected device and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly sanitizes command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and using CLI commands that contain crafted arguments. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the underlying root shell of the affected device and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx48001 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx48001\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-34722\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H",
