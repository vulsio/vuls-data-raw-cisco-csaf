				"text": "It was previously published that a vulnerability in the memory management of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to corrupt a shared memory segment, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls to a shared memory resource. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by corrupting a shared memory segment on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload. The device will recover from the corruption upon reboot.\r\n\r\nAfter additional investigation it was determined that this vulnerability is not exploitable in production software. Cisco has provided software updates for this issue.\r\n\r\n",
