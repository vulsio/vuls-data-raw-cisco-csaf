An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on an affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-command-inject-LBdQ2KRN [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-command-inject-LBdQ2KRN\"]",

By default, the remote management feature is disabled for these devices.\r\n\r\nDetermine the Device Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface and choose Basic Settings > Remote Management. If the Enable box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.",
