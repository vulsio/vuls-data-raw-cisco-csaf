An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a Unix shell on an affected device and then invoking the sudoedit command with crafted parameters or by executing a binary exploit. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands or binaries with root privileges.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sudo-privesc-jan2021-qnYQfcM [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sudo-privesc-jan2021-qnYQfcM\"]",
