In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1357: Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM & Presence Service Path Traversal Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CM IM&P could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct path traversal attacks and obtain read access to sensitive files on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read files on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvv20985 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv20985\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1357\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1355: Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM & Presence Service SQL Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CM IM&P could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-submitted parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain data that is stored in the underlying database, including hashed user credentials.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvv20974 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv20974\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1355\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1364: Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM & Presence Service SQL Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CM IM&P could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative credentials to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-submitted parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain data that is stored in the underlying database.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
