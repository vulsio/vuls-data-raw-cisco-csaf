				"text": "A vulnerability in the SSH Server process of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to overwrite and read arbitrary files on the local device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of arguments that are supplied by the user for a specific file transfer method. An attacker with lower-level privileges could exploit this vulnerability by specifying Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) parameters when authenticating to a device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges and retrieve and upload files on a device that they should not have access to.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 2021 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2021 Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74637\"].",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCisco fixed this vulnerability in Cisco IOS XR Software releases 7.3.2 and 7.4.1.\r\n\r\nCisco has released the following SMUs to address this vulnerability. Customers who require SMUs for platforms or releases that are not listed are advised to contact their support organization.\r\n        Cisco IOS XR Software Release  Platform  SMU Name          6.2.3  ASR9K-PX  asr9k-px-6.2.3.CSCvx48017      6.3.3  ASR9K-PX  asr9k-px-6.3.3.CSCvx48017      6.3.15  NCS5500  ncs5500-6.3.15.CSCvx48017      6.4.2  ASR9K-PX  asr9k-px-6.4.2.CSCvx48017      6.5.2  NCS5500  ncs5500-6.5.2.CSCvx48017      6.5.3  ASR9K-PX  asr9k-px-6.5.3.CSCvx48017      6.5.3  XRV9K  xrv9k-6.5.3.CSCvx48017      6.6.12  IOSXRWBD  iosxrwbd-6.6.12.CSCvx48017      6.6.25  NCS5500  ncs5500-6.6.25.CSCvx48017      6.6.3  IOSXRWBD  iosxrwbd-6.6.3.CSCvx48017      6.6.3  NCS5500  ncs5500-6.6.3.CSCvx48017      6.7.3  ASR9K-PX  asr9k-px-6.7.3.CSCvx48017      6.7.4  CRS-PX  hfr-px-6.7.4.CSCvx48017      7.0.1  NCS5500  ncs5500-7.0.1.CSCvx48017      7.2.1  IOSXRWBD  iosxrwbd-7.2.1.CSCvx48017      7.2.1  NCS1001  ncs1001-7.2.1.CSCvx48017      7.2.2  IOSXRWBD  iosxrwbd-7.2.2.CSCvx48017      7.2.2  NCS5500  ncs5500-7.2.2.CSCvx48017      7.2.2  XRV9K  xrv9k-7.2.2.CSCvx48017      7.1.2  XRV9K  xrv9k-7.1.2.CSCvx48017      7.1.2  NCS5500  ncs5500-7.1.2.CSCvx48017      7.1.2  NCS560  ncs560-7.1.2.CSCvx48017",
