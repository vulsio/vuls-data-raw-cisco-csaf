An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to a specific field in the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as a user with root-level privileges.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

Note that the feature is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nAdministrators can disable the remote management feature by choosing Firewall > General and unchecking the Remote Management check box. Disabling the feature will disable the web-based management interface on the WAN IP address, which is reachable through the WAN ports. The interface will still be available on the LAN IP address, which is reachable through the LAN ports.\r\n\r\nWhile this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.",
