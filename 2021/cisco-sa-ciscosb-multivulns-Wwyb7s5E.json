In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1542: Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches Weak Session Management Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in session management for the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication protections and gain unauthorized access to the interface. The attacker could obtain the privileges of the highjacked session account, which could include administrative privileges on the device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the use of weak session management for session identifier values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using reconnaissance methods to determine how to craft a valid session identifier. A successful exploit could allow the attacker take actions within the management interface with privileges up to the level of the administrative user.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx57925 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx57925\"]\r\nCVE ID:CVE-2021-1542\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1541: Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches Remote Command Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system. The attacker must have valid administrative credentials on the device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of parameter validation for TFTP configuration parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering crafted input for specific TFTP configuration parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a root user on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx57935 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx57935\"]\r\nCVE ID:CVE-2021-1541\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.2\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1543: Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link and access a specific page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information and redirect the user to an arbitrary page.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx57830 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx57830\"]\r\nCVE ID:CVE-2021-1543\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1571: Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches HTML Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in web-based management of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a HTML injection attack.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper checks of parameter values in affected pages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a crafted link that is designed to pass HTML code into an affected parameter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the contents of a web page to redirect the user to potentially malicious websites.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvx57830 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx57830\"]\r\nCVE ID:CVE-2021-1571\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N",
