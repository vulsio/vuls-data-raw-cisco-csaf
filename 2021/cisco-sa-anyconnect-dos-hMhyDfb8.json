An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by copying a crafted file to a specific folder on the system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the VPN Agent service when the affected application is launched, causing it to be unavailable to all users of the system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on a multiuser Windows system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
