				"text": "A vulnerability in the Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) service of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of incoming UPnP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted UPnP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

If UPnP is disabled on both the LAN and WAN interfaces, the device is not considered vulnerable.\r\n  Determine the UPnP Configuration\r\nTo determine whether the UPnP feature is enabled on the LAN interface of a device, open the web-based management interface and navigate to Basic Settings > UPnP. If the Disable check box is unchecked, UPnP is enabled on the device.",

Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations.
