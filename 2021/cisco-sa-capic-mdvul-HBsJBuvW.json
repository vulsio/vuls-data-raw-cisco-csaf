An attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted input during a specific command execution. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root-level privileges on an affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw57577 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw57577\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1580\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1581: Cisco APIC File Upload Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in an API endpoint of Cisco APIC or Cisco Cloud APIC could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload files on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper access control. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specific API endpoint to upload files on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to fill the upload partition of the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw57581 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw57581\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1581\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L",
