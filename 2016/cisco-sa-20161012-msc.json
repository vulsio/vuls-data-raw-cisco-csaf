This vulnerability is due to the XMPP service incorrectly processing a deprecated authentication scheme. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to access the system as another user.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability in some environments are available.\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161012-msc[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161012-msc\"]",

An administrator can determine if XMPP is enabled using the \r\nxmpp\r\n command and the software version can be identified using the \r\nversion\r\n command.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nFor example, the following command shows the version of a device running software version 2.0.6:\r\n\n\r\n\r\nsystem> version\r\n2_0_6\r\n\r\nAnd the following command shows a device with XMPP configured:\n\r\n\r\nsystem> xmpp status\r\nEnabled                 : true\r\nClustered               : true\r\nDomain                  : cisco.com\r\nListening interfaces    : a\r\nKey file                : acano.key\r\nCertificate file        : acano.crt\r\nCA Bundle file          : ca-bundle.crt\r\nMax sessions per user   : unlimited\r\nSTATUS                  : XMPP clustering (Follower)\r\n\r\n",
