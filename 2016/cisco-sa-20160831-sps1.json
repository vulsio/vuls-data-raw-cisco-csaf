				"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Plus (Sx220) Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160831-sps1[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160831-sps1\"]",
