Stopping certain critical processes could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, and certain security features could no longer be available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to lack of proper access controls when using systems utilities to troubleshoot certain system processes. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and using the system utilities to stop certain FireAMP processes. An exploit could allow the attacker to stop certain FireAMP processes.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161207-fireamp[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161207-fireamp\"]",
