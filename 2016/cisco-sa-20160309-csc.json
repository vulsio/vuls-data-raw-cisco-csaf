An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending HTTPS packets through the affected system at high rate.Â \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160309-csc[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160309-csc\"]",
