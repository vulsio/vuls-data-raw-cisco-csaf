An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by continuously trying to establish Telnet or SSH connections to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an integrity issue with the vty line configuration.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161012-cbr-8[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161012-cbr-8\"]",
