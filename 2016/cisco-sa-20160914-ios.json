An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user to access a malicious link or by intercepting the user request and injecting the malicious code. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\n\r\n[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/cmb/cisco-amb-20060922-understanding-xss.html\"]\n\r\nAdditional information about XSS attack and potential mitigations can be found at:\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/cmb/cisco-amb-20060922-understanding-xss.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/cmb/cisco-amb-20060922-understanding-xss.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
