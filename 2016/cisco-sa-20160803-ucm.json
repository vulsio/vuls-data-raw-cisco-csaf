				"text": "A vulnerability in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) processing functions of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager Instant Messaging (IM) and Presence Service could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Cisco SIP Proxy Daemon (sipd) process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper input validation of SIP packet headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SIP packet to a targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the sipd process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition on the system. If the sipd process restarts repeatedly, a successful exploit could also result in a sustained DoS condition and cause high disk utilization due to a large number of sipd core files being written to disk, which could exacerbate the DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160803-ucm[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160803-ucm\"]",

If the vulnerability is exploited repeatedly on a device, a large number of sipd core file could be generated and written to disk, causing high disk utilization.\n\r\n\n\r\nContact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to review the sipd core files and system log files to determine whether the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdministrators can display all active core files on a disk by using the utils core active list command in the CLI for the device. The names of sipd core files will adhere to the following syntax: core.xxxx.sipd.xxxxx\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether sipd core files are using a high percentage of disk space, administrators can use the show diskusage common sort command in the CLI. To delete sipd core files from a disk, administrators can use the following command in the CLI:\r\n\r\nfile delete activelog /core/core.*.sipd.* noconfirm\r\n",
