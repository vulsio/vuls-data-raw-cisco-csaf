				"text": "A vulnerability in the IP Detail Record (IPDR) code of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected system to reload.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of IPDR packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPDR packets to an affected system. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160928-ipdr[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160928-ipdr\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 28, 2016, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 10 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 11 vulnerabilities. All the vulnerabilities have a Security Impact Rating of “High.” For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2016 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-56513\"].",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects the following products running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cisco cBR Series Converged Broadband Routers\r\n    Cisco uBR7200 Series Universal Broadband Routers\r\n    Cisco uBR7225VXR Universal Broadband Routers \r\n    Cisco uBR10000 Series Universal Broadband Routers\r\n\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software[\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\n\r\n\n\r\nDevices running an affected release of software are affected if the IPDR feature is enabled and if the IPDR exporter is started. IPDR exporter is not enabled by default. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo verify the status of an IPDR exporter, use the show ipdr exporter command and verify that the exporter is started. The following example shows a Cisco uBR10000 router with the IPDR exporter started:\n\r\n\r\nrouter#show ipdr exporter \nIPDR exporter is started.\nCurrent parameters:\n    KeepAliveInterval   :300  \n    AckTimeInterval     :60   \n    AckSequenceInterval :200\r\n\r\n\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the command-line interface (CLI), and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 with an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version \nCisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Mon 22-Jun-15 09:32 by prod_rel_team\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nFor information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS Software releases, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"].\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS XE Software or similar text.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.16.1aS:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\nCisco IOS XE Software, Version 03.16.01a.S - Extended Support Release\r\nCisco IOS Software, ASR1000 Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.5(3)S1a, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Wed 04-Nov-15 17:40 by mcpre\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nFor information about the naming and numbering conventions for Cisco IOS XE Software releases, see White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/ios-nx-os-reference-guide.html\"].\r\n",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n        Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\n        To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\n        Customers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\n        \r\n            Initiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\n            Enter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse \r\n            Create a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n        \r\n        To determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release—for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.1.4S—in the following field:\r\n\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n            \r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n",
