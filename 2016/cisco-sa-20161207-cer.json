An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.\n\r\n\n\r\nMore information about CSRF is in Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28726\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161207-cer[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161207-cer\"]",
