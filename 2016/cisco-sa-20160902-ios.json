				"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) server functionality in Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access data from a packet buffer that was previously used.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the use of a previously used packet buffer whose content was not cleared from memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a PPTP connection request to device that is running a vulnerable release of the affected software and is configured for PPTP server functionality. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access up to 63 bytes of memory that were previously used for a packet and were either destined to the device or generated by the device. An exploit would not allow the attacker to access packet data from transit traffic. In addition, an exploit would not allow the attacker to access arbitrary memory locations that the attacker chooses.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160902-ios[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160902-ios\"]",
