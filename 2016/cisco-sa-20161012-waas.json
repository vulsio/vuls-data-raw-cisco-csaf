				"text": "A vulnerability in the SSL session cache management of Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to high consumption of disk space. The user would see a performance degradation. Â \n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of file size limitations for SSL system files stored on the disk. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a continuous stream of SSL traffic to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to the adverse impact on device performance.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161012-waas[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161012-waas\"]",
