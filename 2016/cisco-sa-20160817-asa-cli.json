Cisco recommends that customers of all networking vendors include in their operational procedures methods for preventing and detecting compromise. Please refer to the Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco ASA Firewall[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/asa-5500-x-series-next-generation-firewalls/200150-Cisco-Guide-to-Harden-Cisco-ASA-Firewall.html\"], which contains information to help secure Cisco ASA devices and increase the overall security of the network."
