An authenticated attacker with a user role other than Administrator could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the Cisco PRSM. An exploit could allow the attacker to change the password of any user on the system, including users with the Administrator role.\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160203-prsm[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160203-prsm\"]\n",
