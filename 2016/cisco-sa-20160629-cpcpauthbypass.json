The attacker could be granted full administrator privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an improper implementation of LDAP authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging into a targeted device that is configured for LDAP authentication. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could grant the attacker full administrator privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized re-seller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html.\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\n\r\n \n\r\nFixed Releases\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in Prime Collaboration Provisioning software Patch_CSCuv37513_10.6_SP2.zip.
