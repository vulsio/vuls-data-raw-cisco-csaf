An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected system to follow a malicious link. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160817-sch[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160817-sch\"]",
