				"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewalls, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Routers, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow on a targeted system, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input for fields in HTTP requests that are sent when a user configures an affected device by using the web-based management interface for the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an HTTP request that contains configuration commands with a crafted payload. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow on the targeted system, which could cause the device to reload unexpectedly and result in a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\n\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160615-rv2[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160615-rv2\"]",

By default, the remote management feature is disabled for the affected devices.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface for the device and then choose Basic Settings > Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.",
