An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP packet to an affected device. An successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\n",
