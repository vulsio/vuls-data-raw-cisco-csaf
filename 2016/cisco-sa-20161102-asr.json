				"text": "A vulnerability in the Slowpath of StarOS for Cisco ASR 5500 Series routers with Data Processing Card 2 (DPC2) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a subset of the subscriber sessions to be disconnected, resulting in a partial denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper processing during the handoff of reassembled IPv4 or IPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv4 or IPv6 fragments across the ASR 5500 Series router. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an instance of the sessmgr service on the affected device to reload. A reload of the sessmgr service will cause all subscriber sessions serviced by that task to be disconnected, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161102-asr[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161102-asr\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco ASR 5500 devices with Data Processing Card 2 (DPC2) running StarOS 18.0 or later.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco StarOS is running, administrators can use the show version command in the command-line interface (CLI). The following example shows the output of the show version command for a router that is running Cisco StarOS Release 19.2.1:\n\r\n\n\r\n    [local]ASR-2# show version\n    Friday August 12 13:17:31 AST 2016\n    Active Software:\n      Image Version:                  19.2.1\n      Image Build Number:             62564\n      Image Description:              Deployment_Build\n      Image Date:                     Thu Dec 31 20:13:39 EST 2015\n      Boot Image:                     /flash/asr5500-19.2.1.bin\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether DPC2 cards are in use on a device, administrators can use the show card table command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the show card table command for a router that has active DPC2 cards in slots 2 and 3:\n\r\n\n\r\n    [local]ASR-2# show card table\r\n    Friday August 12 13:18:25 AST 2016\r\n    Slot         Card Type                  Oper State     SPOF  Attach\r\n    -----------  -------------------------  -------------  ----  ------\r\n     1: DPC      None                       -              -           \r\n     2: DPC      Data Processing Card 2     Active         No          \r\n     3: DPC      Data Processing Card 2     Active         No          \r\n     4: DPC      None                       -              -              \r\n     .\r\n     .\r\n     .",
