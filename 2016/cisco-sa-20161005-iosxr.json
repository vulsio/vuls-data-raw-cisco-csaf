An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and sending crafted user input to execute commands on the underlying operating system. The user has to be logged-in to the device with valid admin credentials.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-iosxr[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-iosxr\"]",
