				"text": "A vulnerability in Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Link State Advertisement (LSA) handling by Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n \n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the number of OSPF Path Computation Elements (PCEs) that are configured for an OSPF LSA opaque area update. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted OSPF LSA update to an affected device that is running the vulnerable software and OSPF configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition due to the OSPF process restarting when the crafted OSPF LSA update is received.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160104-iosxr[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160104-iosxr\"]",
