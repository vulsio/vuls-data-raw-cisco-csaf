An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging another exploit that allows the attacker to gain access to an unprivileged shell. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify or replace existing system files with malicious files.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160620-ipp[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160620-ipp\"]",
