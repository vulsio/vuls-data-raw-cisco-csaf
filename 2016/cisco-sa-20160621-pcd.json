An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor additional information, please refer to  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection[\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
