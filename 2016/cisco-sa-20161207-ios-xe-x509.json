An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by presenting an invalid X.509 signature to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate an existing valid user over an SSH connection.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161207-ios-xe-x509[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161207-ios-xe-x509\"]",
