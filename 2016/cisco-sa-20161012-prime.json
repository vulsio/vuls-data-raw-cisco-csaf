				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Evolved Programmable Network Manager SQL database interface could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact system confidentiality by executing a subset of arbitrary SQL queries that can cause product instability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on user-supplied input within SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161012-prime[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161012-prime\"]",
