				"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges on a targeted device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of HTTP request headers that are sent to the web-based management interface of an affected device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains malicious SQL statements to the management interface of a targeted device. Depending on whether remote management is configured for the device, the management interface may use the SQL code in the HTTP request header to determine user privileges for the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication on the management interface and gain administrative privileges on the device.\n\r\nCisco released a firmware update that addresses this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160127-rv220[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160127-rv220\"]\r\n",

				"text": "To work around this vulnerability, administrators can disable or restrict access to remote management functionality for an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nDisable Remote Management \r\nCaution: If a WAN connection must be used to manage a device, do not disable remote management functionality for the device. Disabling this functionality will result in the loss of all remote management connectivity for the device and prevent use of Cisco QuickVPN to access the device.\r\n\r\nBy disabling remote management functionality, administrators help ensure that only users on the same LAN as the device can access configuration and other settings for the device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of an attempted or successful exploit. Remote management is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nIf remote management is enabled, administrators can disable it by doing the following in the management interface:\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n    In the navigation tree, choose Administration > Management Interface > Web Access.\r\n    Next to Remote Management, check the Disable check box.\r\n    Click Save.\r\n\r\nRestrict Access to Remote Management\r\n\r\nIf remote management functionality is required, administrators can restrict access to this functionality by allowing only specific IP addresses to access configuration and other settings for the device. Note that this workaround does not prevent an attacker from spoofing an IP address that is configured on the device. By default, access from any IP address is supported.\r\n\r\nTo restrict access to remote management, administrators can do the following in the management interface:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the navigation tree, choose Administration > Management Interface > Web Access.\r\n    Use the remote management IP address settings to specify which IP addresses can access device settings.\r\n    Click Save.\r\n",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\n http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html[\" http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Versions\r\n\r\nA fix for this vulnerability is included in Release 1.0.7.2 of the firmware for Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall devices.
