An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending packets that meet one or more filter criteria through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the filters defined in the PACL for a targeted system.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-catalyst[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-catalyst\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers that have a Supervisor Engine 720 Module or Supervisor Engine 32 Module running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software, if all the following conditions exist for the device:\n\r\n\r\n    The mls acl tcam share-acl command is configured.\r\n    A PACL includes an ACE that contains a greater than operator, a less than operator, a tcp flag, the established keyword, or the range keyword.\r\n    The PACL is applied to more than eight interfaces.\r\n    \r\n\r\nIf all these conditions are met, an affected device will not apply filters that are in the same PACL and also contain a greater than operator, a less than operator, a tcp flag, the established keyword, or the range keyword.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor example, if the mls acl tcam share-acl command is configured for a device, a PACL is applied to nine of the device's interfaces, and the PACL contains the following ACE, the device will allow all TCP traffic without honoring the established keyword:\n\r\n\r\npermit tcp any any established\r\n\r\nNote that other ACEs in the PACL will work if they do not include an affected operator or keyword. The PACL will not be bypassed completely. Only additional use of the affected operators or keywords will not be applied.",
