An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root-level privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released and will not release a firmware update to address this vulnerability. Mitigations for this vulnerability are available. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\n\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160803-rv180_2[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160803-rv180_2\"]",

This will result in loss of management connectivity to the device. Disabling this feature prevents Cisco QuickVPN access.\n\r\n\n\r\nRemote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled, administrators can disable it using the Web Access screen: Administration > Management Interface > Web Access. Check the box for Disabled in the Remote Management field.\n\r\n\n\r\nDisabling remote management helps ensure that only users on the LAN could attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities. Remote management is not enabled by default on the device.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nLimit Remote Management Access to Specific IP Addresses\n\r\n\n\r\nIf remote management is required, harden the device so that it can be accessed only by certain IP addresses, rather than the default setting of any. By accessing the configuration screen (Administration > Management Interface > Web Access), an administrator can change the Remote IP address field to ensure only devices with specified IP addresses can access the device.",
