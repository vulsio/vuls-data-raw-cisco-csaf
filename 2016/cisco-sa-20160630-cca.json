An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running GET queries to the administrative endpoints of the Cloud Network Automation Provisioner (CNAP) Application Programming Interface (API), providing access to other administrative controllers that do not utilize authentication or authorization-checking mechanisms.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160630-cca[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160630-cca\"]",
