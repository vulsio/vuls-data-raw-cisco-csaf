				"text": "A vulnerability in the ASIC UDP ingress receive function of Cisco Gigabit Switch Router (GSR) 12000 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition when one line card in the router unexpectedly restarts.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper input validation for the presence of a Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) header on the UDP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted UDP packet with a specific UDP port range to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial denial of service condition when a line card unexpectedly restarts.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160311-gsr[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160311-gsr\"]",
