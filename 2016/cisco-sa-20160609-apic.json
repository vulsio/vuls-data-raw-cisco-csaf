An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device and escalating their privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and take full control of the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160609-apic[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160609-apic\"]",
