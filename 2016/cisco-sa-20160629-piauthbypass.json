				"text": "A vulnerability in the application programming interface (API) of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access and control the API resources.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper input validation of HTTP requests for unauthenticated URIs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected URIs. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker to upload malicious code to the application server or read unauthorized management data, such as credentials of devices managed by Cisco Prime Infrastructure or EPNM.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  \n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160629-piauthbypass[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160629-piauthbypass\"]\r\n",
