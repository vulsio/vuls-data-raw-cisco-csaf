				"text": "A vulnerability in Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) and Web Security Appliances (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition due to the AMP process unexpectedly restarting.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of a Java Archive (JAR) file that is scanned when AMP is configured. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a JAR file and attaching this JAR file to an email that is then sent through the ESA, or allowing the JAR file to be download from the web through the WSA.Â An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco ESA and WSA AMP process to unexpectedly restart due to the malformed JAR file.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\n\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esawsa3[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esawsa3\"]",
