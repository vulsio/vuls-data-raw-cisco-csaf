An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets through a targeted system.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-firepower[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-firepower\"]",

Administrators can access the CLI via the serial console or an SSH session to the management interface of the device. The following example shows the output of the show version command for a Cisco FirePOWER 8130 appliance that is running Cisco FirePOWER System Software  Release 5.4.0.3:\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n> show version\n------------------[ Sourcefire3D ]------------------\nModel                     : Cisco FirePOWER 8130 (63) Version 5.4.0.3 (Build xx)\n\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n",
