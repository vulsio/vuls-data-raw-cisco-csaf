				"text": "A vulnerability in the ICMP implementation in the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode Switch could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the switch to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of an ICMP packet with the IPv4 Type 7 option for record route. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an ICMP packet with the record route option to an interface on the affected switch. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition because the switch will reload each time the ICMP packet is received.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. A workaround that addresses this vulnerability is available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160203-n9knci[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160203-n9knci\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco\r\nservice contract and customers who make purchases through third-party\r\nvendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their\r\npoint of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical\r\nAssistance Center (TAC):\n\r\n\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\n\r\n \n\r\nFixed Versions\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI Mode Switch ICMP Record Route Vulnerability is fixed in versions 11.0(1c) and later.
