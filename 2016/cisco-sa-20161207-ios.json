				"text": "A vulnerability in Cisco IOS on Catalysts Switches and Nexus 9300 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Layer 2 network storm.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability occurs because the software forwards Layer 2 frames that should be consumed by the first hop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting the Layer 2 frame into the network segment. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a Layer 2 network storm and impact the availability of the switches.\r\n\r\nThere are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161207-ios [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161207-ios\"]",
