An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request with custom user data. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root-level privileges on the affected system, which could be leveraged to conduct further attacks.\r\n\r\nCisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160615-rv [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160615-rv\"]",

By default, the remote management feature is disabled for the affected devices.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, open the web-based management interface for the device and then choose Basic Settings > Remote Management. If the Enable check box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt [\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in this section.\r\n\r\nFor the Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, this vulnerability was addressed in firmware release 1.0.3.16.\r\n\r\nFor other affected devices, Cisco plans to release the following firmware updates in the third quarter of 2016:\r\n\r\nCisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Release 1.2.1.7\r\nCisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router, Release 1.3.0.8\r\nFirmware updates can be downloaded from the Software Center [\"http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com by navigating to Products > Routers > Small Business Routers > Small Business RV Series Routers.",
