An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to a targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160727-avs[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160727-avs\"]",
