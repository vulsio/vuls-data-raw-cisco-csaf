An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a flood of specially crafted IP packets to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Cisco FirePOWER module to cease inspecting traffic or go offline.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\n\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-fpkern[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-fpkern\"]",
