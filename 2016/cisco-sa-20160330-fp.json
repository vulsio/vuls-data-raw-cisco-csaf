				"text": "A vulnerability in the malicious file detection and blocking features of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass malware detection mechanisms on an affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper input validation of fields in HTTP headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass malicious file detection or blocking policies that are configured for the system, which could allow malware to pass through the system undetected.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160330-fp[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160330-fp\"]",

The dashboard displays a list of file action policies that are configured for the system.\r\n    Click the Report icon next to a policy to see details about the current saved configuration for the policy.\r\n\r\n\n\r\nEach file action policy specifies a set of rules and actions that define how to handle files that meet specific criteria. If one or more policies specify a  Block Files, Block Malware, or Detect Files action, the system is vulnerable.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability also affects the open source Snort project if the source code is compiled with the --enable-file-inspect configuration flag. For more information, see the Snort website[\"https://www.snort.org/\"].",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\n\r\n\n\r\nFixed Releases\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been addressed in the following releases of Cisco Firepower System Software:\n\r\n\r\n    5.4.0.7 and later\r\n    5.4.1.6 and later\r\n    6.0.1 and later\r\n\r\nCustomers should install the appropriate fixed release by using the software update features of Cisco Firepower Management Center.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability has also been addressed in Snort versions 2.9.8.2 and later.
