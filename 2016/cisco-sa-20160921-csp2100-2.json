An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious dnslookup request to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160921-csp2100-2[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160921-csp2100-2\"]",

Customers may only install and expect\r\nsupport for software versions and feature sets for which they have\r\npurchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise\r\nusing such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of\r\nthe Cisco software license: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a\r\nvalid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco\r\nauthorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance\r\nupgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security\r\nsoftware updates do not entitle customers to a new software license,\r\nadditional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade\r\ncontain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software\r\nconfigurations will continue to be supported properly by the new\r\nrelease. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to\r\ncontact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted\r\nmaintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco\r\nservice contract and customers who make purchases through third-party\r\nvendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their\r\npoint of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical\r\nAssistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\n\r\n\n\r\n[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]Customers should have the product serial number available and be\r\nprepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement\r\nto a free upgrade.\n\r\n\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Cloud Services Platform (CSP) 2100 release 2.1.0 and later.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo download a release of Cisco Cloud Services Platform Software, visit the Software Center on Cisco.com and navigate to Products > Switches > Virtual Networking > Cloud Services Platform 2100",
