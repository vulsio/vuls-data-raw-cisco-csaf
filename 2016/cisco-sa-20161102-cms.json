				"text": "A vulnerability in Cisco Meeting Server and Meeting App could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the software does not perform sufficient boundary checks on user-supplied data. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv6 input to the vulnerable function. A successful exploit could result in an exploitable buffer underflow condition. An attacker could leverage this buffer underflow condition to incorrectly allocate memory and cause a reload of the device or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161102-cms[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161102-cms\"]",

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts[\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x\"] page, to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]. Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in the following firmware versions:\n\r\n\r\n    Acano Server version 1.8.16 and later \r\n    Acano Server version 1.9.3 and later \r\n    Cisco Meeting Server 2.0.1 and later \r\n    Acano Meeting Apps version 1.8.35\r\n    Cisco Meeting App version 1.9.8\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Meeting Server firmware updates can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com by navigating to Products > Conferencing > Video Conferencing > Multiparty Conferencing > Meeting Server > Meeting Server 1000 > TelePresence Software.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers can download Acano Server Release 1.9.5 and Acano Server Release 1.8.17 from the FTP library[\"ftp://ftp.acano.com/software/server/\"] on the Acano website.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco Meeting App firmware updates can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com by navigating to Products > Conferencing > Video Conferencing > Multiparty Conferencing > Meeting App.\n\r\n\n\r\nAcano Meeting Apps software version 1.8.35 can be obtained from the software download[\"https://www.acano.com/support/downloads/\"] section of the Acano website.",
