				"text": "A vulnerability in the email filtering functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) filters that are configured for an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper error handling when malformed Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) headers are present in an email attachment that is sent through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email message that has a crafted, MIME-encoded file attachment through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass AMP filter configurations for the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161116-esa1[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161116-esa1\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects all releases prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for both virtual and hardware versions of Cisco Email Security Appliances, if the AMP feature is configured to scan incoming email attachments.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether AMP is configured on a Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), administrators can use the Cisco AsyncOS System Administration GUI or the command-line interface (CLI).\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the System Administration GUI, choose Security Services > File Reputation and Analysis, and then check the setting for the File Reputation option.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the CLI, issue the ampconfig command and check the value of the File Reputation field in the command output. The following example shows the output of the ampconfig command for an ESA that has AMP configured to scan incoming email attachments:\r\n\r\nciscoesa> ampconfig\r\n\r\nFile Reputation: Enabled\r\nFile Analysis: Enabled\r\nFile types selected for File Analysis:\r\n     Microsoft Windows / DOS Executable\r\nAppliance Group ID/Name: Not part of any group yet\r\n\r\nTo determine which release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on an ESA, administrators can use the version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the version command for an ESA running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 8.5.7-044:\r\n\r\nciscoesa> version\r\n\r\nCurrent Version\r\n===============\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance\r\nModel: X1070\r\nVersion: 8.5.7-044\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nNote that Cisco provides regular maintenance of products in the Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) service solution, which includes Cisco Email Security Appliances and Cisco Content Security Management Appliances. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.",
