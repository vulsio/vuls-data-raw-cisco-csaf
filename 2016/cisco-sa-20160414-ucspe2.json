An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted filename arguments to the system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the system or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160414-ucspe2[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160414-ucspe2\"]",
