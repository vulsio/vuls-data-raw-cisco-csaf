				"text": "A vulnerability in the Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV) generic routing encapsulation (GRE) implementation of the Cisco Nexus 7000 and 7700 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation performed on the size of OTV packet header parameters, which can result in a buffer overflow. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted OTV UDP packet to the OTV interface on an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the system or cause a reload of the OTV related process on the affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.  A workaround to mitigate this vulnerability is available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\n\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-otv[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-otv\"]",

The OTV feature was introduced with Cisco NX-OS Software Release 5.0(3) or later for the Nexus 7000 Series, and Cisco NX-OS Software Release 6.2(2) or later for the Nexus 7700 Series. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether a Nexus device is configured to use the OTV functionality, administrators can use the show running | include otv command from the NX-OS command-line interface (CLI) and verify that the feature is enabled. The following example shows the OTV feature enabled on Nexus 7700 Series Switch:\n\r\n\r\nnxos-switch# show running-config | include otv\nfeature otv\n  otv join-interface ...\nnxos-switch#\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a device is running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software, administrators can use the show version command in the NX-OS CLI.
