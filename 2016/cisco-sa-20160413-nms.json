An attacker could exploit earlier software releases to map the network and gather information for further attacks.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160413-nms[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160413-nms\"]",
