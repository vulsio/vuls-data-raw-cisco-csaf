An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to be processed by the affected software. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the application to stop functioning properly, leading to a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-7053\r\n\r\nOpenSSL ChaCha20/Poly1305 Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the *-CHACHA20-POLY1305 cipher suites in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a targeted system to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied data by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting large amounts of crafted data to the *-CHACHA20-POLY1305 cipher suites of the affected software over a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected software to crash, resulting in a DoS condition on the targeted system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-7054\r\n\r\nOpenSSL Montgomery Multiplication May Produce Incorrect Results Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in OpenSSL could cause authentication or key negotiation failures, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to Montgomery multiplication mathematical errors that occur when using OpenSSL with elliptic curve algorithms. The vulnerability may occur without any external attacker action when performing cryptographic operations. Errors resulting from incorrect mathematical computations could cause OpenSSL to fail during authentication or key negotiation, resulting in a DoS.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2016-7055\r\n\r\nFor additional details about the vulnerabilities, refer to the November 2016 OpenSSL Security Advisory [\"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20161110.txt\"] published by the OpenSSL Software Foundation.",
