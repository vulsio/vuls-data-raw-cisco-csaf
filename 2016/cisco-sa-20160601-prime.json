An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code on the underlying operating system with the reduced privileges of the web server.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\n\r\n \n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):\n\r\n\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\n\r\n\n\r\nFixed Releases\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:\n\r\n\n\r\ncisco-sa-20160525-prime[\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160525-prime\"]: Cisco Prime Network Analysis Module Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\r\ncisco-sa-20160525-prime3[\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160525-prime3\"]: Cisco Prime Network Analysis Module IPv6 Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nVersion 6.1 of Cisco Prime NAM software is addressed via a patch named:  nam-security-patch.6.1-2-final.i386.rpm\n\r\n\n\r\nVersion 6.2 of Cisco Prime NAM software is resolved with software release 6.2(1) and later.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe fixed software can be found via the Cisco Software Center in the following location:\n\r\n\n\r\nProducts > Cloud and Systems Management > Network Analysis Module (NAM) Products\n",
