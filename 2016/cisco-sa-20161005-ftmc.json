This may lead an authenticated web user to run arbitrary system commands as the www user account on the server. An attacker with user privileges on the web application may be able to leverage this vulnerability to gain access to the underlying operating system.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-ftmc[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-ftmc\"]",
