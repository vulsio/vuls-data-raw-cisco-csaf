An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the web browser with the privileges of the user. \n\r\n\n\r\nMore information can be found at the following link: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)[\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.
