In some circumstances, responses may be returned in a manner that causes the response to be written past the end of the allocated buffer. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS response to a targeted system. Successful exploitation could trigger a stack-based buffer overflow condition that the attacker could use to execute arbitrary code or cause a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the following CVE ID: CVE-2015-7547",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts  Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.",
