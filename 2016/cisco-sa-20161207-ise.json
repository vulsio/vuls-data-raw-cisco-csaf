				"text": "A vulnerability in the Active Directory integration component of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a denial of service (DoS) attack.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentication requests when ISE is configured with an authorization policy based on Active Directory group membership. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a special but formally correct PAP authentication request that will trigger the issue. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause all subsequent authentication requests for the same Active Directory domain to fail.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161207-ise[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161207-ise\"]",
