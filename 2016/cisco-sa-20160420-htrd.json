				"text": "A vulnerability in the HTTP URL redirect feature of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of HTTP traffic by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow condition on the device, which could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition, or execute arbitrary code on the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160420-htrd[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160420-htrd\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\n\r\n\n\r\nFixed Releases\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:\n\r\n\r\n    cisco-sa-20160420-bdos[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160420-bdos\"]: Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n    cisco-sa-20160420-htrd[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160420-htrd\"]: Cisco Wireless LAN Controller HTTP Parsing Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n    cisco-sa-20160420-wlc[\" http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160420-wlc\"]: Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Management Interface Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco WLC Software.
