An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious link. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160201-apic-em[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160201-apic-em\"]",
