				"text": "A vulnerability in the email filtering for malformed Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) headers of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) and Web Security Appliances (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the filtering functionality of the targeted device. Emails that should have been quarantined could instead be processed.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper error handling when malformed MIME headers are present in the email attachment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email with a crafted attachment encoded with MIME. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured ESA email message and content filtering or WSA service scanning content for web access.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\n\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esawsa2[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esawsa2\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects all releases prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA and Cisco WSA, both virtual and hardware appliances, that are configured with message or content filters to scan incoming email attachments on the ESA or services scanning content of web access on the WSA. The following example shows a configured message filter to scan files with .zip or .exe attachments:\n\r\n\n\r\nTest_Attachment_Rules:\n\r\n    if attachment-filename == \"(?i)\\\\.zip$\" { log-entry(\"Rule attachment-filename found a .zip file\"); }\n\r\n    if attachment-filename == \"(?i)\\\\.exe$\" { log-entry(\"Rule attachment-filename found a .exe file\"); }\n\r\n    if attachment-filetype == \"Compressed\" { log-entry(\"Rule attachment-filetype found type Compressed\"); }\n\r\n    if attachment-filetype == \"Executable\" { log-entry(\"Rule attachment-filetype found type Executable\"); }\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine which release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on an ESA, administrators can use the version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the version command for an ESA running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 8.5.7-044:\n\r\n\r\nciscoesa> version\r\n\r\nCurrent Version\r\n===============\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance\r\nModel: X1070\r\nVersion: 8.5.7-044\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nNote that Cisco provides regular maintenance of products in the Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) service solution, which includes Cisco Email Security Appliances and Cisco Content Security Management Appliances. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the version command in the WSA CLI. The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:\n\r\nciscowsa> version\n\r\nCurrent Version\n\r\n===============\n\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security Appliance\n\r\nModel: S670\n\r\nVersion: 8.5.3-051\n\r\n.\n\r\n.\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\n",
