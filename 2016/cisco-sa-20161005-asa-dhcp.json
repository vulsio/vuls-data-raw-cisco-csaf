				"text": "A vulnerability in the DHCP Relay feature of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition by causing an interface wedge.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of resources linked with the DHCP Relay feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending DHCP packets at specific rates. An exploit could allow an attacker to cause an interface to become wedged, and stop processing incoming traffic. Once this state is reached, restoration of service can only be achieved by reloading the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-asa-dhcp[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-asa-dhcp\"]",
