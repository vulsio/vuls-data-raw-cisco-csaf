				"text": "A vulnerability in the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) scanner of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESA) and Web Security Appliances (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured user filters on the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper error handling of a malformed MIME header in an email attachment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email with a crafted MIME attachment. For example, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured user filters to prevent executable files from being opened. The malformed MIME headers may not be RFC compliant but some mail clients could still allow users to access the attachment, which may not have been properly filtered by the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\n\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esawsa1[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161026-esawsa1\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects all releases prior to the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA and Cisco WSA, both virtual and hardware appliances, that are configured with message or content filters to scan incoming email attachments on the ESA or services scanning content of web access on the WSA. The following is an example of a configured ESA message filter to scan files with .zip or .exe attachments:\n\r\n\n\r\nTest_Attachment_Rules:\n\r\n    if attachment-filename == \"(?i)\\\\.zip$\" { log-entry(\"Rule attachment-filename found a .zip file\"); }\n\r\n    if attachment-filename == \"(?i)\\\\.exe$\" { log-entry(\"Rule attachment-filename found a .exe file\"); }\n\r\n    if attachment-filetype == \"Compressed\" { log-entry(\"Rule attachment-filetype found type Compressed\"); }\n\r\n    if attachment-filetype == \"Executable\" { log-entry(\"Rule attachment-filetype found type Executable\"); }\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine which release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on an ESA, administrators can use the version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the version command for an ESA running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 8.5.7-044:\n\r\n\r\nciscoesa> version\r\n\r\nCurrent Version\r\n===============\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance\r\nModel: X1070\r\nVersion: 8.5.7-044\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nNote that Cisco provides regular maintenance of products in the Cisco Cloud Email Security (CES) service solution, which includes Cisco Email Security Appliances and Cisco Content Security Management Appliances. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the version command in the WSA command-line interface (CLI). The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:\n\r\n\n\r\nciscowsa> version\n\r\nCurrent Version\n\r\n===============\n\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security Appliance\n\r\nModel: S670\n\r\nVersion: 8.5.3-051\n\r\n.\n\r\n.\n\r\n.\n",
