				"text": "A vulnerability in the internal iptables configuration for local interfaces on the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switch could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access certain sensitive data. The attacker could use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect filtering of network traffic destined to certain TCP and UDP ports configured on a local interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the affected device on one of the exposed TCP or UDP ports. An exploit could allow the attacker to discover certain sensitive data which should be restricted and could be used to conduct further attacks.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. A workaround to mitigate this vulnerability is available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\n\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-n9kinfo[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161005-n9kinfo\"]",
