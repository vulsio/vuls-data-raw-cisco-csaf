This account is created at installation and cannot be changed or deleted without impacting the functionality of the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by physically connecting to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to access the system with root user privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160223-nx2000[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160223-nx2000\"]",
