				"text": "A vulnerability in the driver processing functions of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak on the route processor (RP) of an affected device, which could cause the device to drop all control-plane protocols and lead to a denial of service condition (DoS) on a targeted system.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted, fragmented packets that are directed to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted, fragmented packets to an affected device for processing and reassembly. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak on the RP of the device, which could cause the device to drop all control-plane protocols and eventually lead to a DoS condition on the targeted system.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there are mitigations for this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160810-iosxr[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160810-iosxr\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XR Software Releases 5.1.x, 5.2.x, and 5.3.x, prior to the first fixed release or applicable update for those releases, running on Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers. Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers are vulnerable by default if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted, fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets requiring reassembly to the IPv4 or IPv6 unicast address of any interface that is configured on an affected device. The vulnerability can be triggered only by traffic that is destined to an affected device. It cannot be triggered by traffic that is transiting an affected device.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS XR Software Release\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XR Software release is running on a device and the name of the device on which it is running, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the command-line interface (CLI). If the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software, Cisco IOS XR Software or similar text appears in the system banner. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the location of the system image file.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Router that is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.1.3:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router#show version\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XR Software, Version 5.1.3[Default]\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\n\r\nROM: System Bootstrap, Version 2.04(20140227:092320) [ASR9K ROMMON],  \n\r\nrouter uptime is 2 days, 12 hours, 2 minutes\r\nSystem image file is \"bootflash:disk0/asr9k-os-mbi-5.1.3.sp7-1.0.0/0x100000/mbiasr9k-rp.vm\"\n\n\r\ncisco ASR9K Series (P4040) processor with 8388608K bytes of memory.\r\nP4040 processor at 1500MHz, Revision 2.0\r\nASR-9001 Chassis\r\n.\n\r\n.\n\r\n.\r\n\n",

Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects only Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has also confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco ASR 9006, ASR 9010, ASR 9904, ASR 9910, ASR 9912, or ASR 9922 Aggregation Services Routers. In addition, this vulnerability does not affect Cisco 12000 Series Routers, Cisco Carrier Routing System, Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 6000 Series Routers, Cisco NCS 5000 Series Routers, or Cisco NCS 4000 Series Routers that are running Cisco IOS XR Software.",

				"text": "Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause a memory leak in the Software Packet Path (SPP) process on the RP of an affected device, which will cause the device to start dropping routing-protocol packets and management connections and may eventually cause the RP to reload. While experiencing these problems, all traffic that is destined to a device and, depending on the information learned from the routing protocols, all pass-through traffic will be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf a device is exploited, administrators can use the CLI to manually restart the SPP process on the RP, recover leaked buffers, and allow routing-protocol packets and management connections to build. The following example shows how to restart the SPP process and recover leaked buffers:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router#process restart spp location 0/rSP0/CPU0 \r\nSun Jun 24 15:56:46.656 UTC\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:Jun 24 15:56:46.709 : sysmgr_control[65747]: %OS-SYSMGR-4-PROC_RESTART_NAME : User root (con0_RSP0_CPU0)\r\nrequested a restart of process spp at 0/RSP0/CPU0\r\n\r\n\n",
