				"text": "A vulnerability in the web application for Cisco IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software fails to check the bounds of input data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP  request to the web server of a targeted device. A successful exploit  could allow the attacker to remotely execute  code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone,  resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160609-ipp [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160609-ipp\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.
