				"text": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor of Cisco��Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Cisco��Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, and Cisco��Nexus 6000 Series Switches running Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the SNMP application on an affected device to restart unexpectedly.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of SNMP Protocol Data Units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device, which could cause the SNMP application on the device to restart. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\n",

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\n\r\n\n\r\nFixed Releases\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section.
