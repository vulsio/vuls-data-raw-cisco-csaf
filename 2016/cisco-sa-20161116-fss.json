An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly attempting to download FTP malware. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the configured FTP malware blocking rules.\n\r\n\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161116-fss[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20161116-fss\"]",
