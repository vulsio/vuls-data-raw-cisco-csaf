				"text": "A vulnerability in the DHCPv6 relay feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of DHCPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DHCPv6 packets to an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects systems configured in routed firewall mode and in single or multiple context mode. Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability only if the software is configured with the DHCPv6 relay feature. The vulnerability is triggered only by IPv6 traffic.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software release 9.4.1 only.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160420-asa-dhcpv6[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160420-asa-dhcpv6\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license.\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"] \n\r\n \n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades. \n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. \n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. \n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts \n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. \n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco ASA Software.
