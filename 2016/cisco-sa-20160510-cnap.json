An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that include SQL statements to a targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity of some functions.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160510-cnap[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160510-cnap\"]",
