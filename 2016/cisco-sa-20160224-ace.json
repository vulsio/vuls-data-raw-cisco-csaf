				"text": "A vulnerability in the Device Manager GUI of the Cisco ACE 4710 Application Control Engine could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute any command-line interface (CLI) command on the ACE with admin user privileges. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request with injected CLI commands inside the value of a POST parameter value. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the role-based access control (RBAC) restrictions enforced by the Cisco ACE Device Manager GUI.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160224-ace[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160224-ace\"]",

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n \n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n \n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n \n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n \n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\n\r\n \n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\n\r\n\n\r\nFixed Versions\n\r\nThe vulnerability described in this advisory has been fixed in software versions: A5(3.3),  A5(3.2), A5(3.1b), A5(3.1a), and A5(3.1).",
