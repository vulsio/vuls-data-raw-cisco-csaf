An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted AMPDU packet to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160817-aap[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160817-aap\"]",
