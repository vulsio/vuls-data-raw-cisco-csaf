An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by completing multiple handshakes in which the peer uses the same private DH exponent. An exploit could allow the attacker to discover the private DH exponent of a TLS server and conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on the SSL/TLS connection.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2016-0701.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL SSLv2 Doesn’t Block Disabled Ciphers\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the SSL negotiation of OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to negotiate SSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled on the server.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the ability of a malicious client to negotiate SSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled on the server and complete an SSLv2 handshake, even if all SSLv2 ciphers have been disabled. An exploit could allow the attacker to negotiate weak SSLv2 ciphers for SSL/TLS connections, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-3197.",
