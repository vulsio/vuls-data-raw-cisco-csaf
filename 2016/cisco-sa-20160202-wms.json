An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user to access a malicious link or by intercepting the user request and injecting the malicious code. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160202-wms[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160202-wms\"]",
