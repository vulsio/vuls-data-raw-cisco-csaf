An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP packet stream to the detection engine on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\n\r\n \n\r\nFixed Releases\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been addressed in the following releases of Firepower System Software:\n\r\n\r\n    5.4.0.7\r\n    5.4.1.6\r\n    6.0.1\r\n    6.1.0\r\n\r\nTo upgrade the Firepower System Software use one of the following methods:\n\r\n\r\n    With Firepower Management Center (FMC), customers should install the fixed version of the software and apply the access control policy after the installation.\r\n    With Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) or Firepower Device Manager (FDM), customers should upgrade to the fixed version of the software and apply the access control policy after the installation.\r\n",
