				"text": "A vulnerability in the XML application programming interface (API) of Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and access a targeted system through the API.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper implementation of authentication mechanisms for the XML API of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the XML API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform unauthorized configuration changes or issue control commands to the affected system by using the API.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-tpxml[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160504-tpxml\"]",

After logging in to the web interface, the welcome text displays information about the software release that is running on the device.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nFor example, the following welcome text appears for a Cisco TelePresence Magnus SX80 codec that is running software release CE 8.2.0:\r\n\r\nWelcome to Magnus SX80\r\nCisco Codec Release ce 8.2.0 PreAlpha1 c6612ca 2016-04-25\r\nSW Release Date: 2016-04-25 14:58:45, matchbox\r\n",

However, this API is used by the Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS), which means that administrators will not be able to manage the system by using TMS if they disable the API.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo disable the XML API, do the following in the web interface of the software:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    Navigate to xConfig > NetworkServices > XMLAPI > Mode.\r\n    Change the Mode setting to Off.\r\n\r\n\n\r\nReboot the main device for the new configuration to take effect.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\n\r\n\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories and Responses archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt [\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt \"]and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC):\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\n\r\n\n\r\nFixed Releases\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in Cisco TelePresence Codec (TC) and Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software releases TC 7.3.6 and CE 8.1.1.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence Software can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com[\"http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html \"] by navigating to Products > Video > Cisco TelePresence.",
