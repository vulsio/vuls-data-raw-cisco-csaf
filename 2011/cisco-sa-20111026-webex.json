In some cases, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of a targeted user.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. The players can also be manually installed for offline playback after downloading the application from www.webex.com[\"http://www.webex.com\"].\r\n\r\nIf the WRF player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the WRF player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from www.webex.com[\"http://www.webex.com\"].\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111026-webex[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111026-webex\"].\r\n\n\r\n\r\nNote: Effective October 18, 2011, Cisco moved the current list of Cisco Security Advisories and Responses published by Cisco PSIRT. The new location is http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing\"]. You can also navigate to this page from the Cisco Products and Services menu of the Cisco Security (SIO) Portal. Following this transition, new Cisco Security Advisories and Responses will be published to the new location. Although the URL has changed, the content of security documents and the vulnerability policy are not impacted. Cisco will continue to disclose security vulnerabilities in accordance with the published Security Vulnerability Policy[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html\"].",

				"text": "\r\nThe vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WRF players. The Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the players are all affected. Review the following table for the list of releases that contain the nonvulnerable code. Affected versions of the players are those prior to client build T26 SP49 EP40 and T27 SP28. These build numbers are available only to WebEx site administrators. End users will see a version such as \"Client build: 27.25.4.11889.\" This indicates the server is running software version T27 SP25 EP4.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support > Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under \"About Support Center.\" See \"Software Versions and Fixes\" for details.\r\n\r\nCisco recommends that users upgrade to the most current version of the player that is available from www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html[\"http://www.webex.com/downloadplayer.html\"]. If the player is no longer needed, it can be removed using the \"Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller\" or \"Meeting Services Removal tool\" available at support.webex.com/support/downloads.html[\"http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html\"].\r\n\r\nUsers can manually verify the installed version of the WRF player to determine whether it is affected by these vulnerabilities. To do so, an administrator must examine the version numbers of the installed files and determine whether the version of the file contains the fixed code. Detailed instructions on how to verify the version numbers are provided in the following sections. \r\n\r\nThe following tables provide the first nonvulnerable version of each object.\r\nMicrosoft Windows\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) were updated on the Microsoft Windows platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. These files are in the folder C:\\Program Files\\WebEx\\Record Playback or C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Webex\\Record Player. The version number of a DLL can be obtained by browsing the Record Playback directory in Windows Explorer, right-clicking on the file name, and choosing Properties. The Version or Details tab of the Properties page provides details on the library version. The following table gives the first fixed version number for each DLL. If the installed versions are equal to or greater than the versions provided in the table, the system is not vulnerable. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Library\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            T26 SP49 EP40\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            T27 SP11 EP26\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            T27 SP21 EP9\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            T27 SP25 EP3\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            T27 SP28\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            atas32.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Not vulnerable\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2.6.11.0\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2.6.21.5\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2.6.25.0\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2.6.28.0\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            atdl2006.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2.5.49.4000\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2.6.1123.1\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2.6.21.1\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2.6.20.0\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Not vulnerable\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMac\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA package bundle was updated on the Macintosh platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
