Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause an interruption of voice services. Cisco has released free software updates for supported Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions to address the vulnerability. A workaround exists for this SIP vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-cucm[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-cucm\"].\r\n\r\nNote: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories. Nine of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the September 2011 Bundled Publication.\r\n\r\nIndividual publication links are in \"Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication\" at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep11.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep11.html\"]\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software is affected by the SIP vulnerability described in this advisory. A separate Cisco Security Advisory has been published to disclose the vulnerabilities that affect the Cisco IOS software at the following location: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-sip[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-sip\"].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Cisco Unified Communications Manager may leak session control buffers (SCBs) or cause a reload of the affected device when processing a malformed SIP message. Exploitation of the vulnerability may cause a critical process to fail, which could result in the disruption of voice services. All SIP ports (TCP ports 5060 and 5061 and UDP ports 5060 and 5061) are affected.\r\n\r\nThis SIP vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtl86047[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtl86047\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-2072. This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 8.6(1), 8.5(1)su2, and 7.1(5b)su4. [Note, there is not a software Service Update for the 6.x version that contains the fix.]\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability also affects Cisco IOS Software. The corresponding Cisco Bug ID is CSCto88686. Refer to the separate Cisco Security Advisory for the Cisco IOS Software for additional details.\r\n",

				"text": "\r\n\r\n\r\nA workaround exists for customers who do not require SIP in their environment. Cisco Unified Communication Manager versions 6.1(4), 7.1(2) and 8.0(1) introduced the ability to disable SIP processing. SIP processing is enabled by default. Use the following instructions to disable SIP processing:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Step 1: Log in to the Cisco Unified CM Administration web interface.\r\n    Step 2: Navigate to System > Service Parameters and select the appropriate Cisco Unified Communications Manager server and the Cisco CallManager service.\r\n    Step 3: Change the SIP Interoperability Enabled parameter to False and click Save.\n\r\n    \n\r\n    Note: For a SIP processing change to take effect, the Cisco CallManager Service must be restarted. For information on how to restart the service, refer to the \"Restarting the Cisco CallManager Service\" section of the document athttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/admin/7_1_2/ccmcfg/b03dpi.html#wp1075124[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/admin/7_1_2/ccmcfg/b03dpi.html#wp1075124\"] \n\r\n    \n\r\n    It is possible to mitigate these vulnerabilities by implementing filtering on screening devices and permitting access to TCP ports 5060 and 5061 and UDP ports 5060 and 5061 only from networks that require SIP access to Cisco Unified Communications Manager servers. \n\r\n    Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in the network are available in the companion document \"Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin: Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Voice Products\" which is available at the following location: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20110928-voice[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20110928-voice\"] \r\n\r\n[\"file:///Users/rrailton/Documents/PSIRT/augcucmbundle/Sept_bundle/cisco-sa-20110928-cucm-v6.html#Workarounds\"][\"file:///Users/rrailton/Documents/PSIRT/augcucmbundle/Sept_bundle/cisco-sa-20110928-cucm-v6.html#Workarounds\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n[\"http://kbase/paws/psirt/edit-PSA.do#Workarounds\"][\"http://kbase/paws/psirt/edit-PSA.do#Workarounds\"]",
