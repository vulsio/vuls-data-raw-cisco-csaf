This attack is also known as an XML Bomb\r\nreferring to an XML document that is valid according to the rules of an XML\r\nschema yet results in the hanging or crash of the parser or underlying server.\r\nThe attack is often referred to as the Billion Laughs\r\nAttack because many proof of concept examples caused XML parsers to\r\nexpand the string lol or ha up to a\r\nbillion times or until server resources were exhausted. \r\n\r\n The attack combines certain properties of XML to create\r\nvalid but malicious XML using an extreme level of nested substitutions. When an\r\nXML parser attempts to expand all the nested entities it quickly exhausts all\r\nserver resources.\r\n\r\n This technique will cause the XML parsers in Cisco Unified\r\nPresence and Jabber XCP (including JabberNow appliances) to trigger high CPU\r\nand memory usage resulting in process crashes.
