				"text": "The Cisco FWSM for the Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series switches and Cisco 7600 Series routers is affected by multiple vulnerabilities. Affected versions of Cisco FWSM Software vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Refer to the \"Software Version and Fixes\" section for specific information on vulnerable versions.\r\n Syslog Message Memory Corruption Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nDevices running vulnerable versions of Cisco FWSM Software are affected by this vulnerability if the following conditions are satisfied:\r\n\r\n     The device has interfaces with IPv6 addresses\r\n     System logging is enabled (command logging     enable)\r\n     The device is configured in any way to generate system log message     302015 (refer to the following examples)\r\n\r\nSystem log message 302015 has a default severity level of 6 (informational) so, assuming that the system administrator has not changed this default severity level, the vulnerability can be triggered if the device is logging to any destination at level 6 or level 7 (debug). As an example, the following configuration is vulnerable:\r\n\r\n\r\nlogging enable\n! logging console informational logging buffered informational [...]\r\n\r\nUsing a custom message list (via the logging list command) that includes system log message 302015, either by severity or by explicitly including the message ID, is also a vulnerable configuration. For example, the following configuration is also vulnerable:\r\n\r\n\r\nlogging enable\n! logging list MYLIST level informational <and/or> logging list MYLIST message 302015 ! logging trap MYLIST\r\n\r\n Note: The default severity level of system log messages can be changed. If the default severity level of system log message 302015 is changed, and the device is configured to log to any destination at the new severity level, then the device is still vulnerable.\r\n Authentication Proxy Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nDevices running vulnerable versions of Cisco FWSM Software are affected by this vulnerability if they are configured to use Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) for network access, also known as cut-through or authentication proxy. The network access authentication feature is enabled if the aaa authentication match or aaa authentication include commands are present in the configuration of an affected device.\r\n TACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\nDevices running vulnerable versions of Cisco FWSM Software are affected by this vulnerability if they are configured to use the Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) protocol for AAA. A device is configured for TACACS+ if an AAA server group is defined in a manner similar to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\naaa-server my-tacacs-server protocol tacacs+\naaa-server my-tacacs-server (inside) host 192.168.1.1   [...]\r\n\r\n Note: In the preceding example, \"my-tacacs-server\" is the name of the AAA server group.\r\n SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities\r\nDevices running vulnerable versions of Cisco FWSM Software are affected by these vulnerabilities if SunRPC inspection is enabled. SunRPC inspection is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether SunRPC inspection is enabled, issue the show service-policy | include sunrpc command and confirm that the command returns output. Example output follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nFWSM# show service-policy | include sunrpc\n      Inspect: sunrpc, packet 324, drop 5, reset-drop 0\r\n\r\nAlternatively, a device with SunRPC inspection enabled has a configuration similar to the following (the inspect sunrpc command is the command that actually enables SunRPC inspection, although the other commands are necessary for the Cisco FWSM to actually inspect traffic):\r\n\r\n\r\nclass-map inspection_default\n match default-inspection-traffic ! policy-map global_policy  class inspection_default   ...   inspect sunrpc  ! service-policy global_policy global\r\n\r\n Note: The service policy could also be applied to a specific interface. (Global application is shown in the previous example.)\r\n ILS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nDevices running vulnerable versions of Cisco FWSM Software are affected by these vulnerabilities if inspection of the ILS protocol is enabled. ILS inspection is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nRefer to \"SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities\" for information on how to determine if ILS inspection is enabled. Use the configuration keyword \"ils\" instead of \"sunrpc\".\r\n\r\n\r\n How to Determine the Running Software Version\r\nTo determine the version of Cisco FWSM Software that is running on a device, issue the show module command from Cisco IOS Software or Cisco Catalyst Operating System Software to identify what modules and submodules are installed on the system.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a system with a Cisco FWSM (WS-SVC-FWM-1) installed in slot 2:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch>show module\nMod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No. --- ----- -------------------------------------- ------------------ -----------   1   16  SFM-capable 16 port 1000mb GBIC        WS-X6516-GBIC      SAL06334NS9   2    6  Firewall Module                        WS-SVC-FWM-1       SAD10360485   3    8  Intrusion Detection System             WS-SVC-IDSM-2      SAD0932089Z   4    4  SLB Application Processor Complex      WS-X6066-SLB-APC   SAD093004BD   5    2  Supervisor Engine 720 (Active)         WS-SUP720-3B       SAL0934888E  Mod MAC addresses                       Hw    Fw           Sw           Status --- ---------------------------------- ------ ------------ ------------ -------   1  0009.11e3.ade8 to 0009.11e3.adf7   5.1   6.3(1)       8.7(0.22)BUB Ok   2  0018.ba41.5092 to 0018.ba41.5099   4.0   7.2(1)       4.0(16)      Ok   3  0014.a90c.9956 to 0014.a90c.995d   5.0   7.2(1)       7.0(4)E4     Ok   4  0014.a90c.66e6 to 0014.a90c.66ed   1.7   Unknown      Unknown      PwrDown   5  0013.c42e.7fe0 to 0013.c42e.7fe3   4.4   8.1(3)       12.2(33)SXH8 Ok  [...]\r\n\r\nAfter locating the correct slot, issue the show module <slot number> command to identify the software version that is running, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch>show module 2\nMod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No. --- ----- -------------------------------------- ------------------ -----------   2    6  Firewall Module                        WS-SVC-FWM-1       SAD10360485  Mod MAC addresses                       Hw    Fw           Sw           Status --- ---------------------------------- ------ ------------ ------------ -------   2  0018.ba41.5092 to 0018.ba41.5099   4.0   7.2(1)       4.0(16)      Ok  [...]\r\n\r\nThe preceding example shows that the Cisco FWSM is running software version 4.0(16) as indicated by the Sw column.\r\n\r\n Note: Recent versions of Cisco IOS Software will show the software version of each module in the output from the show module command; therefore, executing the show module <slot number> command is not necessary.\r\n\r\nIf a Virtual Switching System (VSS) is used to allow two physical Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series switches to operate as a single logical virtual switch, the show module switch all command can display the software version of all FWSMs that belong to switch 1 and switch 2. The output from this command will be similar to the output from show module <slot number> but will include module information for the modules in each switch in the VSS.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, version information can be obtained directly from the Cisco FWSM through the show version command, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nFWSM> show version\n FWSM Firewall Version 4.0(16) [...]\r\n\r\nCustomers who use the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage their devices can find the version of the software displayed in the table in the login window or in the upper left corner of the Cisco ASDM window. The version notation is similar to the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nFWSM Version: 4.0(16)",

				"text": "The Cisco FWSM is a high-speed, integrated firewall module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series switches and Cisco 7600 Series routers. The FWSM offers firewall services with stateful packet filtering and deep packet inspection.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco FWSM is affected by multiple vulnerabilities, which are described in the following sections.\r\n Syslog Message Memory Corruption Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nThe Cisco FWSM has a system log (syslog) feature that provides information for monitoring normal operation and troubleshooting network or device issues. System log messages are assigned different severities (debugging, informational, error, critical, etc.) and can be sent to different logging destinations.\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability exists in the implementation of one specific system log message (message ID 302015, \"Built outbound UDP connection session-id for src-intf:IP/Port to dst-intf:IP/Port ARP-Incomplete\") that can cause memory corruption and lead to a lock up or crash of the Cisco FWSM in the event that that system log message needs to be generated for IPv6 traffic that has flowed through the device. The Cisco FWSM may not recover on its own and a manual reboot may be necessary to recover.\r\n\r\nSystem log message 302015 has a default severity level of 6 (informational). Changing the default severity level of this system message will not prevent the issue from occurring if the system is logging to any destinations at the new severity level. The Cisco FWSM must have interfaces with IPv6 addresses otherwise the problem does not occur.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID  CSCti83875  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCti83875\"] ( registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3296.\r\n Authentication Proxy Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nThe Cisco FWSM authentication proxy feature allows one to use AAA to control access to network resources. Specifically, the Cisco FWSM cut-through proxy challenges a user initially at the application layer and then authenticates against AAA servers. After the Cisco FWSM authenticates the user, it shifts the session flow, and all traffic flows directly between the user's computer and the network resource being accessed.\r\n\r\nA denial of service vulnerability exists in some versions of Cisco FWSM Software that affects devices configured to use authentication to grant users access to the network, also known as cut-through or authentication proxy. Vulnerable configurations are those that contain the aaa authentication match or aaa authentication include commands. The vulnerability may be triggered when there is a high number of network access authentication requests.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID  CSCtn15697  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtn15697\"] ( registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3297.\r\n TACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\nAAA enables the Cisco FWSM to determine who the user is (authentication), what the user can do (authorization), and what the user did (accounting). The Cisco FWSM supports TACACS+ authentication for VPN users, firewall sessions, and administrative access to the device.\r\n\r\nAn authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the TACACS+ implementation in the Cisco FWSM. Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to bypass TACACS+ authentication of VPN users (the Cisco FWSM only allows VPN sessions for management), firewall sessions, or administrative access to the device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID  CSCto74274  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto74274\"] ( registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3298.\r\n SunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities\r\nThe SunRPC inspection engine enables or disables application inspection for the SunRPC protocol. SunRPC is used by Network File System (NFS) and Network Information Service (NIS). SunRPC services can run on any port. When a client attempts to access a SunRPC service on a server, it must learn the port on which the service is running. The client does this by querying the port mapper process, usually rpcbind, on the well-known port of 111.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco FWSM is affected by four vulnerabilities that may cause the device to reload during the processing of different crafted SunRPC messages when SunRPC inspection is enabled. These vulnerabilities are triggered only by transit traffic; traffic that is destined to the device does not trigger these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs  CSCtq09972  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq09972\"] ( registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) ,  CSCtq09978  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq09978\"] ( registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) ,  CSCtq09986  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq09986\"] ( registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) , and  CSCtq09989  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq09989\"] ( registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) ; and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2011-3299, CVE-2011-3300, CVE-2011-3301, and CVE-2011-3302, respectively.\r\n ILS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nThe ILS inspection engine provides Network Address Translation (NAT) support for Microsoft NetMeeting, SiteServer, and Active Directory products that use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to exchange directory information with an ILS server.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco FWSM is affected by a vulnerability when ILS inspection is enabled that may cause the device to reload during the processing of a malformed ILS message. This vulnerability is triggered by transit traffic only; traffic that is destined to the device does not trigger this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID  CSCtq57802  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq57802\"] ( registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3303.",
