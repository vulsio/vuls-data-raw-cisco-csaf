				"text": "Cisco Nexus OS contains a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a targeted device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user-supplied values to command line interface commands.  An authenticated, local attacker could exploit the vulnerability by issuing commands that contain malicious options on the device command line interface.  If successful, the attacker could gain elevated privileges on the targeted device.\r\n\r\nCisco confirmed the vulnerability within software release notes and released software updates.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must log in locally to a vulnerable device.  Because of the critical function that affected products often serve in most environments, local access to an affected device is likely carefully controlled.  As a result, the source of exploits is restricted to only trusted users currently granted local access, limiting the potential for exploitation.\r\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.\r\n",
