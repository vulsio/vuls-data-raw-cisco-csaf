Nine of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the September 2011 Bundled Publication.\r\n\r\nIndividual publication links are in \"Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication\" at the following link:\r\n\r\n  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep11.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/i/ntelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep11.html\"]",

The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software  by displaying text similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System  Software\" or \"Cisco IOS Software.\" The image name displays in  parentheses, followed by \"Version\" and the Cisco IOS Software release  name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is  running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image  name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\nCisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.
