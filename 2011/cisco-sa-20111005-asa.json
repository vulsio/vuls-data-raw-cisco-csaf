You can then apply the inspection policy map when you enable IM inspection, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy-map type inspect im MY-MSN-INSPECT\r\n parameters\r\n match protocol msn-im \r\n  log\r\n!\r\npolicy-map global_policy\r\n  class inspection_default\r\n    inspect im MY-MSN-INSPECT\r\n\r\nTACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\nAn authentication bypass vulnerability affects the TACACS+ implementation of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable TACACS+ for authentication, authorization, or accounting (AAA), you must first create at least one AAA server group per AAA protocol and add one or more servers to each group with the aaa-server command. You identify AAA server groups by name. The following example shows how a AAA server group is configured for TACACS+ authentication:\r\n\r\n\r\naaa-server my-tacacs-sever protocol tacacs+     \r\naaa-server my-tacacs-server (inside) host 203.0.113.11 \r\n\r\n\r\nSunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities\r\nFour DoS vulnerabilities affect the SunRPC inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.\r\n\r\nSunRPC inspection is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nTo check if SunRPC inspection is enabled, issue the show service-policy | include sunrpc command and confirm that output, such as what is displayed in the following example, is returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show service-policy | include sunrpc\r\n      Inspect: sunrpc, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0\r\n\r\nThe following configuration commands are used to enable SunRPC inspection in the Cisco ASA.\r\n\r\n\r\nclass-map inspection_default\r\n match default-inspection-traffic\r\n!\r\npolicy-map global_policy\r\n class inspection_default\r\n  ...\r\n  inspect sunrpc \r\n  ...\r\n!\r\nservice-policy global_policy global\r\n\r\nILS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA DoS vulnerability affects the ILS inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances.\r\n\r\nILS inspection is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nTo check if ILS inspection is enabled, issue the show service-policy | include ils command and confirm that output, such as what is displayed in the following example, is returned.\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show service-policy | include ils\r\n      Inspect: ils, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0\r\n\r\nThe following configuration commands are used to enable ILS inspection in the Cisco ASA.\r\n\r\n\r\nclass-map inspection_default\r\n match default-inspection-traffic\r\n!\r\npolicy-map global_policy\r\n class inspection_default\r\n  ...\r\n  inspect ils\r\n  ...\r\n!\r\nservice-policy global_policy global\r\n\r\nHow to Determine the Running Software Version\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the show version command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance that is running software version 8.4(1):\r\n\r\n\r\nASA#show version | include Version\r\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) \r\nDevice Manager Version 6.4(1)\r\n\r\nCustomers who use Cisco ASDM to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "\r\nCisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series ASA Services Module are affected by the following vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n\r\nMSN IM Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nThe IM inspect engine lets you apply fine grained controls on the IM application to control the network usage and stop leakage of confidential data, propagation of worms, and other threats to the corporate network.\r\n\r\nA DoS vulnerability affects the MSN IM inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. During successful exploitation, an unauthenticated attacker could cause the affected device to reload and may result in a sustained DoS condition.\r\n\r\nNote:  Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability; traffic that is destined to the appliance will not trigger the vulnerability. MSN IM inspection is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID  CSCtl67486 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtl67486\"]( registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3304\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTACACS+ Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\nAAA enables the ASA to determine who the user is (authentication), what the user can do (authorization), and what the user did (accounting). The Cisco ASA supports TACACS+ authentication for VPN users, firewall sessions, and administrative access to the device.\r\n\r\nAn authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the TACACS+ implementation of the Cisco ASA. Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to bypass TACACS+ authentication of VPN users, firewall sessions, or administrative access to the device. The attacker needs to have access to the network between the ASA and the TACACS+ server in order to successfully exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCto40365 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto40365\"]( registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2011-3298.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSunRPC Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerabilities\r\nThe Sun RPC inspection engine performs application inspection for the Sun RPC protocol. Sun RPC is used by Network File System (NFS) and Network Information Service (NIS). Sun RPC services can run on any port. When a client attempts to access a Sun RPC service on a server, it must learn the port that service is running on. The client does this by querying the port mapper process, usually rpcbind, on the well-known port of 111.\r\n\r\nFour DoS vulnerabilities affect the SunRPC inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, in which an unauthenticated attacker may cause the affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nNote:  Only transit traffic can trigger these vulnerabilities; traffic that is destined to the appliance will not trigger the vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by using UDP packets, not TCP. SunRPC inspection is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCto92380 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto92380\"]( registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) , CSCtq06065 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq06065\"](registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) , CSCtq06062 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq06062\"]( registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) , CSCto92398 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto92398\"]( registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) ; and have been assigned CVE IDs CVE-2011-3299, CVE-2011-3300, CVE-2011-3301 and CVE-2011-3302\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nThe ILS inspection engine provides NAT support for Microsoft NetMeeting, SiteServer, and Active Directory products that use LDAP to exchange directory information with an ILS server.\r\n\r\nA DoS vulnerability affects the ILS inspection feature of Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances. During successful exploitation, an unauthenticated attacker could cause the affected device to reload and may result in a sustained DoS condition.\r\n\r\nNote:  Only transit traffic can trigger this vulnerability; traffic that is destined to the appliance will not trigger the vulnerability. ILS inspection is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtq57697 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq57697\"]( registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE CVE-2011-3303.\r\n\r\n \n\r\n",
