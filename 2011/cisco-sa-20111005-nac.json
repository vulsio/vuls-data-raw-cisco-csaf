The solution identifies whether machines are compliant with security\r\npolicies and repairs vulnerabilities before permitting access to the network.\r\nYou can use the NAC Manager server and its web-based administration console to\r\nmanage multiple NAC Appliances in a deployment.\r\n\r\nCisco NAC Manager contains a directory traversal vulnerability. The\r\nmanagement interface uses TCP port 443. An unauthenticated attacker could\r\nexploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information, including password\r\nfiles and system logs, that could be leveraged to launch subsequent attacks.\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID\r\n\r\nCSCtq10755\r\n[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq10755\"]\r\n(\r\nregistered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)\r\nand has been assigned\r\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2011-3305.\r\n\r\n",
