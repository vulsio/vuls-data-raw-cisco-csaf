The script can be accessed via the web interface.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to lack of input validation of the parameters passed to the user script. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and crafting user input to specific script files to inject arbitrary commands. These commands are at the privilege level of the authenticated user.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151123-fire[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151123-fire\"]",
