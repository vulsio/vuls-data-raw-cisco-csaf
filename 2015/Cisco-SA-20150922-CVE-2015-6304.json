An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the affected web browser with the privileges of the user.\n\n\n\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious website, and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.",
