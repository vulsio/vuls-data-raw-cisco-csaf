An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting input into the affected fields of the web interface.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerabilities and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
