An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to click a crafted URL that is designed to submit malicious code to the affected software.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerabilities; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
