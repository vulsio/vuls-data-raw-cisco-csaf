An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the web browser with the privileges of the user.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released updated software.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\n\r\n\n\r\nDevices running a default configuration of an affected version of software are vulnerable.",
