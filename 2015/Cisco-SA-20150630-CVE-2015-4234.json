				"text": "Multiple privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the Python subsystem of Cisco Nexus devices running Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain elevated privileges.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are due to insufficient hardening of the operating system on which NX-OS is based. An attacker who has sufficient privileges to execute arbitrary Python scripts on an affected device could use this access to obtain root privileges.\n\n\n\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must have local access and authenticate to the targeted device. These requirements could limit the possibility of a successful exploit.\n\n\n\nCisco would like to thank Jens Krabbenhoeft for discovering and reporting this vulnerability.",
