An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious symbolic link to a location not otherwise accessible to the attacker. An exploit could allow the attacker to insert unauthorized content in the linked-to file.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151007-vcs[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151007-vcs\"]",
