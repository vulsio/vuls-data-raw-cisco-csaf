An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the default SSL certificate to view sensitive information.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAlthough a successful exploit could be used by an attacker to view sensitive information on a targeted device, the attacker may use the information gathered to conduct further attacks against the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
