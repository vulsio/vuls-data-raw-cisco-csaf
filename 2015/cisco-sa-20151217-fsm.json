				"text": "A vulnerability in HTTP attack detection within decrypted SSL traffic of CiscoÂ FireSIGHT Management Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass HTTP attack detection. The traffic is SSL and the application is configured to decrypt the SSL connection and detect HTTP-based attacks that are associated with Snort intrusion detection rules.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper HTTP attack detection of decrypted SSL connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by embedding crafted HTTP packets in an encrypted SSL connection that could be flagged as an HTTP attack. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass HTTP attack rules for SSL connections.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151217-fsm[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151217-fsm\"]",
