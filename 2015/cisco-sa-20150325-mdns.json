				"text": "Cisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable. Cisco mDNS Gateway functionality is enabled by default on Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. There is no specific configuration on the affected device needed to process mDNS packets.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco IOS device or Cisco IOS XE device would process mDNS packets, log in to the device and issue either of the following command-line interface (CLI) commands: show ip socket, show udp, or show control-plane host open-ports. If the output shows any IP addresses listening on UDP port 5353, the device is vulnerable.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the socket is open on UDP port 5353:\n\r\nRouter#show ip socket  \r\nProto Remote Port Local Port In Out Stat TTY OutputIF \r\n17 --listen-- 192.168.0.1 67 0 0 1 0 \r\n17 --listen-- 192.168.0.1 68 0 0 1 0 \r\n17 --listen-- 224.0.0.251 5353 0 0 1 0\r\nRouter#\r\n\r\nRouter#sho udp \r\nProto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF\r\n17     224.0.0.251      5353 --any--          5353   0   0 1000021   0 \r\n17(v6) FF02::FB         5353 --any--          5353   0   0 1020021   0 \r\nRouter#\r\n\r\nRouter#sho control-plane host open-ports \r\nActive internet connections (servers and established)\r\nProt               Local Address             Foreign Address                  Service    State\r\n tcp                        *:22                         *:0               SSH-Server   LISTEN\r\n tcp                        *:23                         *:0                   Telnet   LISTEN\r\n udp                      *:5353               224.0.0.251:0         IOS host service   LISTEN\r\nRouter#\r\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: The behavior of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software prior to the fix for Cisco bug ID CSCum51028 is to turn the mDNS functionality on by default. This behavior was changed in response to Cisco bug ID CSCum51028 and is now disabled by default. If the administrator wants to enable mDNS functionality, it must be manually configured on a device.\n\r\n\n\r\nOn Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software releases that have a fix for Cisco bug ID CSCum51028, mDNS Gateway functionality must be explicitly enabled by configuring the service-routing mdns-sd CLI global configuration command. On those releases, if the command service-routing mdns-sd is in the configuration, the device may be vulnerable.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\" or \"Cisco IOS Software. The image name displays in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version \nCisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\nCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\nCompiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team\r\n!--- output truncated\r\n\r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"]. \r\n",

				"text": "The Cisco Service Discovery Gateway (mDNS Gateway) is a Cisco IOS component that allows for controlled and secure access to services and devices across subnets. It listens to service announcements on all configured network segments and builds a cache of services and addresses.\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the multicast DNS (mDNS) gateway function of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to reload the vulnerable device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of mDNS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6) packets on UDP port 5353. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited using either IPv4 or IPv6 packets. The vulnerability can be triggered by malformed packets destined for UDP port 5353 using the IPv4 or IPv6 unicast address of any interface configured on a device, the IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.251, or the IPv6 multicast address FF02::FB.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be triggered only by traffic destined to an affected device and cannot be exploited using traffic transiting an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn devices that meet the vulnerable configuration criteria, malformed UDP mDNS packets could trigger this vulnerability. An attacker with knowledge of the infrastructure could craft mDNS packets with set conditions to exploit this vulnerability. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can result in a reload of the affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCup70579[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup70579\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0650.",

				"text": "Access Control Lists\n\r\n\n\r\nOn Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software releases that do not have a fix for Cisco bug ID CSCum51028, there is currently no way to manually close the port or disable the service.\n\r\n\n\r\nOn those releases, a possible workaround consists of configuring an extended access control list (ACL) that can be created and applied to an interface to block traffic destined to UDP port 5353.\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause the mDNS feature in this vulnerability uses UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. In addition to ACLs, administrators should enable uRPF, a security feature of Cisco IOS Software that verifies the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. The combination of these two technologies offers a stronger workaround than ACLs alone.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following ACL example should be included as part of the deployed interface access list, which will help protect the device from traffic destined to UDP port 5353:\n\r\n!---\r\n!--- Deny IPv4 mDNS traffic to a device\r\n!--- \r\n\r\naccess-list 150 deny udp any any eq 5353  \r\n\r\n!--- Permit/deny all other Layer 3 and Layer 4 IPv4 traffic in \r\n!--- accordance with existing security policies and \r\n!--- configurations. Permit all other traffic to transit the\r\n!--- device.  \r\n\r\naccess-list 150 permit ip any any  \r\n\r\n!---\r\n!--- Deny IPv6 mDNS traffic to a device\r\n!--- \n\r\nipv6 access-list v6_list\r\n  deny udp any any eq 5353  \r\n\r\n!--- Permit/deny all other Layer 3 and Layer 4 IPv6 traffic in \r\n!--- accordance with existing security policies and \r\n!--- configurations. Permit all other traffic to transit the\r\n!--- device.  \r\n\r\npermit ipv6 any any  \r\n\r\n!--- Apply access list to all interfaces (only one example\r\n!--- shown)  \r\n\r\ninterface fastEthernet 2/0 \r\nip access-group 150 in\r\n  ipv6 traffic-filter v6_list in\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nControl Plane Policing\n\r\n\n\r\nControl Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block untrusted UDP traffic to the device. Cisco IOS Software releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP can be configured on a device to help protect the management and control planes and minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic that is sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following CoPP example should be included as part of the deployed CoPP, which will help protect the device from traffic destined to UDP port 5353:\n\r\n!---\r\n!--- Match IPv4 mDNS traffic with permit statement\r\n!--- \r\n\r\naccess-list 150 permit udp any any eq 5353  \r\n\r\n!--- Permit (police or drop)/Deny (allow) all other Layer 3 and \r\n!--- Layer 4 IPv4 traffic in accordance with existing security policies \r\n!--- and configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent \r\n!--- to infrastructure devices \r\n!--- \r\n\r\naccess-list 150 deny ip any any  \r\n\r\n!--- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by\r\n!--- the CoPP feature\r\n!---\r\n\r\nclass-map match-all drop-udp-class \r\nmatch access-group 150\r\n\r\n!--- Create a policy map that will be applied to the \r\n!--- control plane of the device.  \r\n\r\npolicy-map drop-udp-traffic class drop-udp-class drop  \r\n\r\n!--- Apply the policy map to the \r\n!--- control plane of the device  \r\n\r\ncontrol-plane service-policy \r\ninput drop-udp-traffic\r\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the preceding CoPP example, the access control list entries (ACE) that match the potential exploit packets with the permit action cause these packets to be discarded by the policy map drop function, while packets that match the deny action (not shown) are not affected by the policy map drop function. Note that the policy map syntax is different in the 12.2S and 12.0S Cisco IOS software trains:\n\r\npolicy-map drop-udp-traffic \r\n  class drop-udp-class \r\n  police 32000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action drop\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional information about the configuration and use of the CoPP feature is in Control Plane Policing Implementation Best Practices and Control Plane Policing.\n\r\n\n\r\nOn Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software releases that contain a fix for Cisco bug ID CSCum51028, mDNS Gateway functionality can be disabled by configuring the no service-routing mdns-sd CLI global configuration command.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory, which is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=37485[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=37485\"]",

					"details": "Access Control Lists\n\r\n\n\r\nOn Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software releases that do not have a fix for Cisco bug ID CSCum51028, there is currently no way to manually close the port or disable the service.\n\r\n\n\r\nOn those releases, a possible workaround consists of configuring an extended access control list (ACL) that can be created and applied to an interface to block traffic destined to UDP port 5353.\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause the mDNS feature in this vulnerability uses UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. In addition to ACLs, administrators should enable uRPF, a security feature of Cisco IOS Software that verifies the reachability of the source address in packets being forwarded. The combination of these two technologies offers a stronger workaround than ACLs alone.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following ACL example should be included as part of the deployed interface access list, which will help protect the device from traffic destined to UDP port 5353:\n\r\n!---\r\n!--- Deny IPv4 mDNS traffic to a device\r\n!--- \r\n\r\naccess-list 150 deny udp any any eq 5353  \r\n\r\n!--- Permit/deny all other Layer 3 and Layer 4 IPv4 traffic in \r\n!--- accordance with existing security policies and \r\n!--- configurations. Permit all other traffic to transit the\r\n!--- device.  \r\n\r\naccess-list 150 permit ip any any  \r\n\r\n!---\r\n!--- Deny IPv6 mDNS traffic to a device\r\n!--- \n\r\nipv6 access-list v6_list\r\n  deny udp any any eq 5353  \r\n\r\n!--- Permit/deny all other Layer 3 and Layer 4 IPv6 traffic in \r\n!--- accordance with existing security policies and \r\n!--- configurations. Permit all other traffic to transit the\r\n!--- device.  \r\n\r\npermit ipv6 any any  \r\n\r\n!--- Apply access list to all interfaces (only one example\r\n!--- shown)  \r\n\r\ninterface fastEthernet 2/0 \r\nip access-group 150 in\r\n  ipv6 traffic-filter v6_list in\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nControl Plane Policing\n\r\n\n\r\nControl Plane Policing (CoPP) can be used to block untrusted UDP traffic to the device. Cisco IOS Software releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP can be configured on a device to help protect the management and control planes and minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic that is sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following CoPP example should be included as part of the deployed CoPP, which will help protect the device from traffic destined to UDP port 5353:\n\r\n!---\r\n!--- Match IPv4 mDNS traffic with permit statement\r\n!--- \r\n\r\naccess-list 150 permit udp any any eq 5353  \r\n\r\n!--- Permit (police or drop)/Deny (allow) all other Layer 3 and \r\n!--- Layer 4 IPv4 traffic in accordance with existing security policies \r\n!--- and configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent \r\n!--- to infrastructure devices \r\n!--- \r\n\r\naccess-list 150 deny ip any any  \r\n\r\n!--- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by\r\n!--- the CoPP feature\r\n!---\r\n\r\nclass-map match-all drop-udp-class \r\nmatch access-group 150\r\n\r\n!--- Create a policy map that will be applied to the \r\n!--- control plane of the device.  \r\n\r\npolicy-map drop-udp-traffic class drop-udp-class drop  \r\n\r\n!--- Apply the policy map to the \r\n!--- control plane of the device  \r\n\r\ncontrol-plane service-policy \r\ninput drop-udp-traffic\r\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the preceding CoPP example, the access control list entries (ACE) that match the potential exploit packets with the permit action cause these packets to be discarded by the policy map drop function, while packets that match the deny action (not shown) are not affected by the policy map drop function. Note that the policy map syntax is different in the 12.2S and 12.0S Cisco IOS software trains:\n\r\npolicy-map drop-udp-traffic \r\n  class drop-udp-class \r\n  police 32000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action drop\r\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional information about the configuration and use of the CoPP feature is in Control Plane Policing Implementation Best Practices and Control Plane Policing.\n\r\n\n\r\nOn Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software releases that contain a fix for Cisco bug ID CSCum51028, mDNS Gateway functionality can be disabled by configuring the no service-routing mdns-sd CLI global configuration command.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory, which is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=37485[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=37485\"]"
