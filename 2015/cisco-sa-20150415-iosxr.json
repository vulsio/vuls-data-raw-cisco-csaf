				"text": "A vulnerability in the packet-processing code of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers (ASR) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of a network processor chip and the line card that is processing traffic. Only Typhoon-based line cards on Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers are affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper processing of packets that are routed via the bridge-group virtual interface (BVI) when any of the following features are configured: Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), policy-based routing (PBR), quality of service (QoS), or access control lists (ACLs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending IPv4 packets through an affected device that is configured to route them via the BVI interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of a network processor chip and the line card that is processing traffic, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds to address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150415-iosxr[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150415-iosxr\"]",

				"text": "Cisco ASR 9000 Series Routers with Typhoon-based line cards are affected by this vulnerability. To be affected by this vulnerability, the device must be configured to route traffic via the BVI and must also have any of the following features configured: uRPF, PBR, QoS, or ACLs.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv4 packets that are further routed via BVI. IPv6 packets, or IPv4 packets directed to an affected device, cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nBy default BVI, uRPF, PBR, QoS, and ACLs are not enabled in Cisco IOS XR Software.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether BVI is configured on a device, use the show running-config | include bvi privileged EXEC command. The presence of interface bvi in the output of show running-config | include bvi indicates that BVI is configured.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following is the output of the show running-config | include bvi command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software with the BVI configured:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show running-config | include bvi\n interface bvi 50\n\n\r\nTo determine whether uRPF is enabled on an interface, use the show running-config | include verify privileged EXEC command. The presence of ipv4 verify unicast source reachable-via rx in the output of show running-config | include verify indicates that uRPF is enabled.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following is the output of the show running-config | include \"verify source\" command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software with the uRPF feature enabled:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show running-config | include \"verify source\"\n ipv4 verify unicast source reachable-via rx\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether PBR is configured on a device, use the show running-config policy-map | include pbr privileged EXEC command. The presence of policy-map type pbr in the output of show running-config policy-map | include pbr indicates that PBR is configured.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following is the output of the show running-config policy-map | include pbr command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software with the PBR feature enabled:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show running-config policy-map | include pbr\n policy-map type pbr TEST_PBR\n\n\r\nTo determine whether ACLs are enabled on an interface, use the show running-config | include access-group privileged EXEC command. The presence of ipv4 access-group in the output of show running-config | include access-group indicates that ACLs are configured.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following is the output of the show running-config | include access-group command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software with the ACL feature enabled:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show running-config | include access-group\n ipv4 access-group TEST_IN ingress\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether QoS is enabled on an interface, use the show running-config | include service-policy privileged EXEC command. The presence of service-policy input or service-policy output in the output of show running-config | include service-policy indicates that QoS is configured.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following is the output of the show running-config | include service-policy command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software with the QoS feature configured:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show running-config | include service-policy\n service-policy input test_in\n service-policy output test_out\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe second generation of the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Ethernet line cards is referred to as Typhoon-based line cards. The term comes from the network processors (NPs) that are used on these line cards.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following line cards are Typhoon based:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    A9K-MOD80-SE\r\n    A9K-MOD80-TR\r\n    A9K-MOD160-SE\r\n    A9K-MOD160-TR\r\n    A9K-24X10GE-SE\r\n    A9K-24X10GE-TR\r\n    A9K-36X10GE-SE\r\n    A9K-36X10GE-TR\r\n    A9K-2X100GE-SE\r\n    A9K-2X100GE-TR\r\n    A9K-1X100GE-SE\r\n    A9K-1X100GE-TR\r\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether the line card on an ASR 9000 Series Router is Typhoon based, the administrator can use the show diag command. Affected devices will include the product ID (PID) for at least one of the Typhoon-based cards. The following example shows a device on which an A9K-24X10GE-SE card is active: \n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:router(admin)# show diag\n\nMon Jun 22 12:55:10.554 PST\n\nNODE module 0/RSP0/CPU0 : \n\n  MAIN:  board type 0x100302\n\n!--- output truncated\n\nNODE module 0/1/CPU0 :  \n\n  MAIN:  board type 0x20207\n  S/N:   FOC123081J6\n  Top Assy.
