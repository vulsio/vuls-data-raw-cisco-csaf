				"text": "A vulnerability in the administrative web interface of Cisco Unified MeetingPlace could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack on an affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JavaScript snippet in the attacker's website and then convincing a MeetingPlace administrator to visit the malicious website that allows the arbitrary JavaScript to be executed. An exploit could allow the attacker to access privileged information.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
