				"text": "A vulnerability in IP version 6 (IPv6) processing in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the ipv6_io service.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper processing of a malformed IPv6 packet by a device configured to process such packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed IPv6 packet to be processed by a device that is configured for IPv6. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the ipv6_io service.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need to acquire additional information about the targeted device, such as whether the device is configured to process IPv6 packets. A device configured to process IPv6 packets is required for a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
