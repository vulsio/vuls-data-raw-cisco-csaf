				"text": "A vulnerability in the TCP module of the Cisco Videoscape Policy Resource Manager (PRM) product could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to disable TCP ports and cause an increase in CPU and memory usage.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of rate limiting in the TCP listening application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a TCP SYN flood or denial of service (DoS) traffic stream. An exploit could allow the attacker to block TCP listening ports and exhaust system resources such as CPU and memory.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAffected devices that are deployed in internal networks are at lower risk of exploitation because attackers may require access to internal networks to send malicious network traffic.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the event of an exploit, attackers would not be able to recover any confidential information or take control of a device, so the overall impact to the device is low.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
