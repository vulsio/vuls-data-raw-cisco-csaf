The following example shows a Cisco IPS 4345 that is running software version 7.1(3)E4:\r\n\r\nsensor# show version\nApplication Partition:\n\nCisco Intrusion Prevention System, Version 7.1(3)E4\n\nHost:\n    Realm Keys          key1.0\nSignature Definition:\n    Signature Update    S605.0        2011-10-25\nOS Version:             2.6.29.1\nPlatform:               IPS-4345-K9\r\n\r\nCustomers who use Cisco Intrusion Prevention System Device Manager (IDM)\r\nto manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is\r\ndisplayed in the login window or top left corner of the Cisco IDM\r\nwindow.",

				"text": "A vulnerability within the SSL/TLS subsystem utilized by the web management interface\r\nof Cisco Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Software could allow an\r\nunauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)\r\ncondition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a potential race condition when handling multiple HTTPS requests on the management interface. An attacker could exploit this\r\nvulnerability by negotiating a number of HTTPS connections with the management interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to make the MainApp process unresponsive. This creates a DoS condition because the Cisco IPS sensor is not able to execute several critical tasks including alert notification, event store management, and sensor authentication. The Cisco IPS web server is also unavailable while the MainApp process is unresponsive. \n\r\n\n\r\nAdditionally, due to this general system failure, other processes such as the Analysis Engine may not work properly. The Cisco IPS may not continue to process traffic because the Analysis Engine process may not work properly. If the Cisco IPS is configured in promiscuous mode, mitigation actions that require MainApp processing such as the request-block-host or request-rate-limit event-actions may be unavailable. If the Cisco IPS is configured in inline mode, the sensor may not correctly perform inspection and mitigation actions, and may drop packets transiting the affected device. The condition persists until the device has been restarted.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability can be triggered only by SSL/TLS traffic directed to the TCP port and IP address of the management interface associated with the web server. The default TCP port is 443. Packets transiting an affected device through the sensing interfaces cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in CSCuq40652[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuq40652\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0654\n\r\n\n\r\nTo recover from the DoS condition, find and block the attacking device then reload from a console command line. \n\r\n\n\r\nAs\r\na best practice Cisco recommends maintaining the IPS management access list, carefully allowing only trusted hosts to access the\r\nmanagement interface of the IPS device. Blocking access using the access list can prevent a successful attack.",
