An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DHCP packets to the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be on the same broadcast or collision domain as the targeted device to send crafted DHCP packets to the device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
