An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using crafted USB user inputs to send invalid USB commands to the kernel.\n\n\n\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available. \n\n\n\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151116-fire[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151116-fire\"]",
