				"text": "On January 27, 2015, a buffer overflow vulnerability in the GNU C library (glibc) was publicly announced. This vulnerability is related to the various gethostbyname functions included in glibc and affects applications that call these functions. This vulnerability may allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from an exploited system or, in some instances, perform remote code execution with the privileges of the application being exploited.\r\n\r\nThe glibc library is a commonly used third-party software component that is released by the GNU software project and a number of Cisco products are likely affected.\r\n\r\nThis advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available. Cisco will release free software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150128-ghost [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150128-ghost\"]",

				"text": "A buffer overflow was found in the GNU C library's (glibc) __nss_hostname_digits_dots() function, which, in turn, is used by the gethostbyname(), gethostbyname2(), and other glibc function calls. The vulnerable code in the affected functions is designed to prevent DNS lookups for addresses that do not need to be resolved (i.e. they are already IPv4 or IPv6 addresses). These vulnerable functions are commonly used by networking applications.\r\n\r\nSystems that contain glibc versions 2.2 to 2.17 are affected by this vulnerability. Applications that statically link to an affected version are also affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this vulnerability varies based on hardware and software configurations. A remote, unauthenticated attacker that is able to provide a hostname to an application that is using an affected function may be able to exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from memory or perform remote code execution with the same privileges as the process or application being exploited.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0235.\r\n\r\nMore information provided for each bug ID listed in the \"Vulnerable Products\" section of this advisory can be found in the Cisco Bug Search Tool [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/\"].",
