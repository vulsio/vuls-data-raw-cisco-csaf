An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting POST requests to the targeted system.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. These requirements would likely decrease the possibility of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
