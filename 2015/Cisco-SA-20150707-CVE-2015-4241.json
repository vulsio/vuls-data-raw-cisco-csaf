				"text": "A vulnerability in the Open Shortest Path First version 2 (OSPFv2) code of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause the reload of the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of OSPFv2 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to the affected system. A successful exploit could cause the system to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be on the same broadcast or collision domain as the targeted system. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
