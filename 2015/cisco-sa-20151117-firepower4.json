				"text": "A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco Firepower 9000 Series Switch could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to affect the integrity of the device though a clickjacking or phishing attack.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization of iFrame data in the HTTP requests sent to the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets with malicious iFrame data. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform a clickjacking or phishing attack where the user is tricked into clicking a malicious link. Protection mechanisms should be used to help prevent this type of attack.\r\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151117-firepower4 [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151117-firepower4\"]",
