				"text": "A vulnerability in the event manager environment and publish-event function of the Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack with root-level privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of event manager environment variables that are configured on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device with administrative privileges, modifying the configuration of the device, and then invoking a crafted event manager script. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to compromise the affected system using commands that are executed with root-level privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151130-csr[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151130-csr\"]",
