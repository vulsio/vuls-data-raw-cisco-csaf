An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the web browser with the privileges of the user.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerabilities. However, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\n",
