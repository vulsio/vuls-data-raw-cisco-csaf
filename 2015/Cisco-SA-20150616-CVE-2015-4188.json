				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Prime Collaboration Manager interface could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impact the confidentiality of the system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must submit malicious requests to the targeted system, making exploitation more difficult in environments that restrict network access from untrusted sources.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
