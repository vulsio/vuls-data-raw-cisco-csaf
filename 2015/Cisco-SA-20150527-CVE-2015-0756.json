				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP traffic to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device and the associated wireless access points.Â \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the same broadcast or collision domain as the targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
