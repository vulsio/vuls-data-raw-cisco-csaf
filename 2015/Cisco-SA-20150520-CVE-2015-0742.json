				"text": "A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) application of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to disrupt the multicast traffic forwarding on the affected device via a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an inconsistency in how the PIM registration is implemented for multicast forwarding. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted multicast packet to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to disrupt the multicast forwarding via a DoS attack.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and software updates are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to send specially crafted multicast packets to the affected device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\r\n\n\r\nAn attacker may need to acquire additional information about the targeted device prior to an exploit attempt, such as whether the device is running with a multicast configuration. A multicast configuration is needed for a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
