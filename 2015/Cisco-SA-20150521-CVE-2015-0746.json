				"text": "A vulnerability in the Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API) of the Cisco Access Control Server (ACS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to how the ACS REST API handles increased traffic load. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large numbers of requests to a targeted device to increase traffic load on the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ACS REST API to reject or fail to service valid requests, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to send large numbers of requests to the affected device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.\n",
