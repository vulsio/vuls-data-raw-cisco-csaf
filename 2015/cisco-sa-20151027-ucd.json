An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enumerating all possible URIs and gathering the answers that the server gives to those paths. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine the file system structure and which URIs are valid resources.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151027-ucd[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151027-ucd\"]",
