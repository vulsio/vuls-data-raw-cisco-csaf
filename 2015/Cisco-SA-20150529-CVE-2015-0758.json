An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the administrator of an affected system to import a crafted XML file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker read access to sensitive information stored on an affected system, which could be used to conduct further attacks.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to a targeted device in addition to convincing an administrator of the device to import a crafted XML file. These requirements could limit the possibility of a successful exploit.",
