				"text": "A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Unity Connection (UC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the confidentiality of the system by executing arbitrary SQL queries. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a maliciously crafted value containing SQL commands as an HTTP POST request parameter. An exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database.Â \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must\r\nauthenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce\r\nthe likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code\r\nexists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Paul Heneghan from NCIA/NCIRC.\n\r\n",
