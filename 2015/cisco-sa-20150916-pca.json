An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\r\na crafted URL to the system. The attacker would need to be logged in to\r\nthe system to exploit this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nAn exploit could\r\nallow the attacker to access functions, some of which should be accessible only\r\nto users who have administrative privileges.\r\nBecause of this vulnerability, an attacker could create an\r\nadditional administrative user or access information from another domain if the\r\nsystem is used in multiple tenants environment.\n\n\n\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCus62671[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus62671\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and CSCus62652[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus62652\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-4304\n\n\n\nCisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\n\n\nA vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Prime Collaboration\r\nAssurance   could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access\r\ninformation about any device imported into the system database.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability is due to improper implementation of authorization and\r\naccess controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\r\ncrafted URLs to the system. The attacker would need to be logged in to\r\nthe system to exploit this vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\nAn exploit could\r\nallow the attacker to access information about devices imported into the\r\nsystem database, including devices for other customers or domains.\r\nThe information that an attacker could retrieve includes SNMP\r\ncommunity strings and devices' administrative credentials. This would allow the attacker to gain administrative access to these devices.\n\n\n\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCus62656[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus62656\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and CVE ID CVE-2015-4305.\n\n\n\nCisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Session ID Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\n\n\n\nA vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Prime Collaboration\r\nAssurance   could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access\r\ninformation about users who are logged in to the system, including users' session identifiers.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper\r\nimplementation of authorization and access controls. An attacker could\r\nexploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs to the system. The\r\nattacker would need to be logged in to the system to exploit\r\nthis vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\nAn exploit could allow the attacker to access\r\ninformation about users who are logged in to the system, including users' session identifiers. Using this identifier, an attacker could\r\nimpersonate any user, including administrative users, for any domain or\r\ncustomer if the system is configured for multiple tenants.\r\nUsing this information, an attacker could perform any privileged\r\nfunctions during the time the session ID is valid.\n\n\n\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCus88343[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus88343\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and CSCus88334[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus88334\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and CVE ID CVE-2015-4306.",
