An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the IP address of the Cisco WLC and triggering client disconnections. The attacker must reach the Cisco WLC management IP address on port 80 or port 443 via its wired interface.\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. A workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is available.
