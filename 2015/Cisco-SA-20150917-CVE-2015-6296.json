A local attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using the insecure default account to gain additional privileges on the affected device. If successful, the attacker could gain root privileges and possibly compromise the affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available. \r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device with local account access. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco  indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
