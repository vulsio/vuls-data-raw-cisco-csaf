An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted traffic, causing updates to timers used by the Zone-Based Firewall feature.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks behind a firewall to send crafted traffic to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
