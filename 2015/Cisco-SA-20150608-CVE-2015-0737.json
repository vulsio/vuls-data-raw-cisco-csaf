				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters passed via HTTP GET or POST methods. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting the user packets and injecting malicious code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco would like to give credit to Liad Mizrachi & Oded Vanunu from The Check Point Security Research Team for reporting this vulnerability.",
