An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to visit a malicious website. If successful, the attacker could conduct an XSS attack and execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser session or gain access to sensitive information.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.\n",
