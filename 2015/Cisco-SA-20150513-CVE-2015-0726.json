				"text": "A vulnerability in the web administration interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of certain parameters submitted as part of form requests prior to processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted request to a targeted device. If successful, the attacker could cause the device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
