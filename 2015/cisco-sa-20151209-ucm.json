An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by spoofing a user's identity and taking ownership of the edge device. A successful exploit will allow the attacker to setup and receive voice calls acting as the registered user of the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151209-ucm[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151209-ucm\"]",
