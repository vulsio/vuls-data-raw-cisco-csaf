Additionally, application layer gateway (ALG) or zone-based policy firewall inspection of such packets may be needed to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 packets. Packets destined to an affected device or IP version 6 (IPv6) packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending large IPv4 packets that require fragmentation and reassembly when packets requiring ALG inspection traverse a device that is configured for NAT and HSL.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software may be affected by this vulnerability if NAT, HSL and ALG are enabled on an affected device; these services are not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nALG inspection is enabled on a device when NAT is enabled. ALG inspection engines available on Cisco IOS XE depend on the software version and may include Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), H.323, Skinny, Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), and other protocols.\r\n\r\nAdministrators can choose to disable any ALG inspection under the NAT configuration.\r\n\r\nIf the packet used in an exploit attempt does not require ALG inspection, this vulnerability can still be exploited if the zone-based policy firewall is configured, in addition to NAT and HSL, and processing such packets.\r\n\r\nThe following matrix shows the potential impact for a combination of enabled features and packets that may require ALG:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fragmented packets that may need ALG\r\n\r\n  Fragmented packets that do not need ALG\r\n\r\nNAT/HSL\r\n\r\n  Vulnerable\r\n\r\n  Not Vulnerable\r\n\r\nNAT/HSL/zone-based policy firewall\r\n\r\n  Vulnerable\r\n\r\n  Vulnerable\r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the ip nat inside or ip nat outside commands must be on different interfaces and at least one ip nat global configuration command must be in the configuration.\r\n\r\nThe show running-config | include ip nat command can be used to determine whether NAT is in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:\r\nRouter#show running-config | include ip nat\r\n ip nat inside\r\n ip nat outside\r\n ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1\r\nTo determine whether ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration, use the show running-config | include ip nat privileged EXEC command. The presence of no ip nat service in the output of show run | include ip nat indicates that ALG is disabled in the NAT configuration.\r\n\r\nThe following is the output of show running-config | include ip nat in Cisco IOS XE Software that has the SIP ALG disabled in the NAT configuration:\r\nRouter#show running-config | include ip nat\r\nip nat inside\r\nip nat outside\r\nip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1 vrf sip\r\nno ip nat service sip udp port 5060\r\nno ip nat service sip tcp port 5060\r\nIf no ip nat service is not in the output of show running-config | include ip nat, the Cisco IOS XE Software release running on the device is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether HSL has been enabled in the Cisco IOS XE Software configuration, the ip nat log translations flow-export command must be in the configuration.\r\n\r\nThe show running-config | include ip nat command can be used to determine whether HSL is in the configuration, as illustrated in the following example of a vulnerable configuration:\r\nRouter#show running-config | include ip nat\r\n ip nat inside\r\n ip nat outside\r\n ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1\r\n ip nat log translations flow-export v9 udp destination 10.10.0.1 1020 source GigabitEthernet 0/0/0\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software Crafted TCP Packet Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could cause an affected device to reload or execute arbitrary code when processing crafted TCP packets that belong to a connection that is inspected by an AppNav-XE controller component. A device is vulnerable only if multiple AppNav-XE controllers are configured.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 TCP packets. Packets destined to an affected device or IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe AppNav-XE controller component is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether AppNav-XE with multiple controllers is configured on a device, use the show service-insertion appnav-controller-group privileged EXEC command. The presence of multiple IP addresses under the configured appnav-controller-group in the output of show service-insertion appnav-controller-group indicates that AppNav-XE with multiple controllers is configured on a device.\r\n\r\nThe following output is for AppNav-XE on Cisco IOS XE Software configured with multiple controllers:\r\nRouter# show service-insertion appnav-controller-group\r\nAll AppNav Controller Groups in service context\r\nAppnav Controller Group : acg\r\nMember Appnav Controller Count : 2\r\nMembers:\r\nIP Address\r\n 21.0.0.36\r\n21.0.0.160\r\n\r\nAppNav Controller : 21.0.0.36\r\nLocal AppNav Controller : Yes\r\nCurrent status of AppNav Controller : Alive\r\n  <output suppressed>\r\nCisco IOS XE Software Crafted IPv6 Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing crafted IPv6 packets when IPv6 is configured on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv6 packets destined to an affected device. Packets transiting an affected device or IPv4 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted IPv6 packets that require punt operations when a device is configured for IPv6.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software may be affected if IPv6 is enabled on an interface that is processing traffic. IPv6 is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether IPv6 is enabled on an interface, use the show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address) privileged EXEC command. The presence of ipv6 enable and ipv6 address in the output of show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address) indicates that IPv6 is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe following is the output of the show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address) in Cisco IOS XE Software that shows the device is configured for IPv6:\r\nRouter# show running-config | include ipv6.(enable|address) ipv6 enable  ipv6 address dhcp rapid-commit ipv6 address autoconfig  ipv6 address MANAGEMENT ::1FFF:0:0:0:3560/128 ipv6 address 2001:DB8::1/64\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software Layer 4 Redirect Crafted Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that may cause an affected device to reload while processing crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packets when Layer 4 Redirect (L4R) is configured on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited only with IPv4 or IPv6 subscriber packets transiting an affected device. In normal operation, those packets are redirected to specified servers when a device running Cisco IOS XE Software is configured for L4R functionality. Packets destined to an affected device cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted IPv4 or IPv6 packets that require Layer 4 redirection when a device that is configured for L4R.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software may be affected if L4R is configured. L4R is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether L4R is configured on a device, use the show running-config | include redirect privileged EXEC command. The presence of redirect server-group and redirect to group in the output of show running-config | include redirect indicates that L4R is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe following is the output of show running-config | include redirect in Cisco IOS XE Software that shows the device is configured for L4R:\r\nRouter# show running-config | include redirect\r\n  redirect server-group TEST_SERVER\r\n  \tredirect to group TEST_SERVER\r\nCisco IOS XE Software Common Flow Table Crafted Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software contains a vulnerability that could cause an affected device to reload when processing crafted IPv6 packets encapsulated in UDP IPv4 packets. A device is vulnerable only if Media Monitoring (MMON) traffic inspection or Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited only with transit IPv4 UDP packets that are carrying IPv6 packets. Packets destined to an affected device, TCP IPv4 packets, or unencapsulated IPv6 packets cannot be used to trigger this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMMON or NBAR traffic inspection is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether MMON inspection of traffic is configured on a device, use the show policy-map type performance-monitor privileged EXEC command. The presence of service-policy in the output of show policy-map type performance-monitor interface indicates that MMON is configured on a device.\r\nThe following output is for a device running Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured with MMON:\r\nRouter#show policy-map type performance-monitor\r\n  Service-policy performance-monitor input: mmon_policy\r\n\r\n    Class-map: class-default (match-any)\r\n      0 packets, 0 bytes\r\n      5 minute offered rate 0000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps\r\n      Match: any\r\n      Total Packets classified: 0\r\n      Total Bytes classified: 0\r\n      Monitor AOR: disabled\r\n\r\n  Service-policy performance-monitor output: mmon_policy\r\n\r\n    Class-map: class-default (match-any)\r\n      0 packets, 0 bytes\r\n      5 minute offered rate 0000 bps, drop rate 0000 bps\r\n      Match: any\r\n      Total Packets classified: 0\r\n      Total Bytes classified: 0\r\n      Monitor AOR: disabled ethernet 0/0\r\nNBAR inspection of IPv6 tunneled traffic on devices running Cisco IOS XE Software is supported for Teredo and IPv6INIP tunnel types.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether NBAR inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured on a device, use the show running-config | include nbar.+(teredo|ipv6inip) privileged EXEC command. The presence of either ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic ipv6inip or ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic teredo in the output of show running-config | include nbar.+(teredo|ipv6inip) indicates that the NBAR inspection of tunneled IPv6 traffic is configured on a device.\r\n\r\nThe following output is for a device running Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured with NBAR traffic inspection for both Teredo and IPv6INIP tunnel types:\r\nRouter# show run | include nbar.+(teredo|ipv6inip)\r\n ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic ipv6inip\r\n ip nbar classification tunneled-traffic teredo\r\nDetermine the Running Software Version  The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS XE releases correspond to the Cisco IOS Software releases. For example, Cisco IOS XE Release 3.6.2S is the software release for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers IOS Release 15.2(2)S2. For more information about mappings between the Cisco IOS XE releases and their associated Cisco IOS releases, see the following:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_intro.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_intro.html\"]\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco IOS XE Software is running on a device, administrators can issue the show version command. The following example shows Cisco IOS XE Software that is running IOS XE Software version 3.6.2S, which maps to Cisco IOS Software version 15.2(2)S2:\r\n\r\nRouter#show version\r\nCisco IOS Software, IOS-XE Software (PPC_LINUX_IOSD-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 15.2(2)S2, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2012 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Tue 07-Aug-12 13:40 by mcpre\r\n<output suppressed>\r\nNote: A Cisco IOS XE Software image consists of seven individual modules, also referred to as packages. The packages are designed to use the In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) capability of Cisco IOS XE Software. Customers can choose to upgrade only those packages that need to be upgraded.
