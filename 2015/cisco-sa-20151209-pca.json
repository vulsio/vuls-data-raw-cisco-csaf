				"text": "A vulnerability in Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance (PCA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the system shell with the default cmuser user account and access the shell with a limited set of permissions.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an undocumented account that has a default and static password. This account is created during installation and cannot be changed or deleted without impacting the functionality of the system. The first time this account is used the system will request that the user change the default password. \n\r\n\n\r\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely connecting to the affected system via SSH by using the undocumented account. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to access the system with the privileges of the cmuser user. This vulnerability allows the attacker to: access some sensitive data, such as the password file, system logs, and Cisco PCA database information; modify some data; run some internal executables; and potentially make the system unstable or inaccessible.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds are available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151209-pca[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151209-pca\"]",

				"text": "On a vulnerable version of Cisco PCA software, an administrator can connect as the root user to verify the password hash of the cmuser user. A value that is different from the one in the following example would indicate that the default password has been changed. A hash that does not match the example could imply that an attacker could have connected to the system and changed the default password.\n\r\n\n\r\n[root@CPCA106 ~]# cat /etc/shadow | grep cmuser cmuser:$6$gfITIXfh$zie5RAtd6e6dlJOxhSvJYeCaXygmbWWlJAqvy8v0ig.l1EADBEMrK0zkvovlusZ2X6ohxQs6GKdEcmvz86VuQ/:0:0:99999:0:::\r\n\n\r\nAdministrators can change the password of the cmuser user by connecting as the root user and using the passwd command.\n\r\n\n\r\nAn administrator could also check the /var/log/secure file and look for connection attempts from the cmuser user. The following example shows an attempt from the cmuser user to connect to the affected system:\n\r\n\n\r\n[root@CPCA106 ~]# cat /var/log/secure | grep cmuser\r\nNov 30 16:24:21 CPCA106 sshd[3975]: pam_unix(sshd:account): expired password for user cmuser (root enforced)\r\nNov 30 16:24:21 CPCA106 sshd[3975]: Accepted password for cmuser from x.x.x.x port 61345 ssh2\r\nNov 30 16:24:21 CPCA106 sshd[3975]: pam_unix(sshd:session): session opened for user cmuser by (uid=0)",
