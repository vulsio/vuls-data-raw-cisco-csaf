				"text": "A vulnerability in the Command Line Interface (CLI) parser of Cisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) devices could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a privilege escalation.\n\r\nÂ \n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper input validation of special characters within filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating at the local shell and writing a file to disk with certain special characters. The attacker could then use that file with other CLI commands to obtain a shell prompt at their current privilege level. An exploit could allow the attacker to read and write files and perform other privileged commands.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access and be able to authenticate to the targeted device. These requirements could limit the possibility of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco would like to thank Jens Krabbenhoeft for discovering and reporting this vulnerability.\n",
