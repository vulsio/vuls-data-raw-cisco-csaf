An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to the Management Interface on the Cisco Content Services Switch (CSS).\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need to acquire additional information, such as the IP address of the Management Interface on a targeted device in order to send crafted packets to the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that proof-of-concept exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.\n",
