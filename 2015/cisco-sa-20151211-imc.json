An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the IMC. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IMC to become inaccessible via the IP interface, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThere are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151211-imc [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151211-imc\"]",
