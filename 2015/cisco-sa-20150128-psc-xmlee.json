				"text": "A vulnerability in the configuration of the XML parser of Cisco Prime Service Catalog could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data or cause system resource consumption that could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML external entities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted HTTP requests to the Prime Service Catalog Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based web services. To complete a successful attack, the attacker also needs a server that is reachable from the Cisco Prime Service Catalog. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access data stored on the host operating system, consume system resources, or cause a DoS condition. The disclosed data could contain sensitive information, which may include private keys and passwords.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCup92880[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup92880\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0581\n\r\n\n\r\nGiven the characteristics of this vulnerability, Cisco recommends customers generate new public/private key pairs, obtain a new certificate for that key pair, and install the new certificate and associated key pair as appropriate on all affected deployments after installing the software updates. Cisco also recommends changing the passwords for access to the host operating system and policy orchestration integration.",
