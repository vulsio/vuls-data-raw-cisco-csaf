An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link or attacker-controlled web page. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script or HTML code on the user's browser within the context of the affected site.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and software updates are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious website and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.\n",
