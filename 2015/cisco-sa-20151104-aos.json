				"text": "A vulnerability in the network stack of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) and Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust all available memory, preventing the affected device from accepting new TCP connections.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of TCP packets sent at a high rate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP packets to the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: A full device reload is needed to recover the system to an operational state.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.

Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.\n\r\n\n\r\nDetermine Software Version\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco ESA, administrators can use the version command in the ESA CLI. The following example shows the results for a device running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoesa> version\r\nCurrent Version\r\n===============\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance\r\nModel: X1070\r\nVersion: 8.5.3-051\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco SMA, administrators can use the version command in the SMA CLI. The following example shows the results for a device running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 9.1.1-005:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscosma> version\r\nCurrent Version\r\n===============\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort M670 Security Management(tm) Appliance\r\nModel: M670\r\nVersion: 9.1.1-005\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the version command in the WSA CLI. The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscowsa> version\nCurrent Version\n===============\nProduct: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security Appliance\nModel: S670\nVersion: 8.5.3-051\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n",
