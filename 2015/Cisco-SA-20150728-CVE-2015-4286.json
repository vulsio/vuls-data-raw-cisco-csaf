An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information.\n\n\n\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to send crafted HTTP requests to the targeted device, making exploitation more difficult in environments that restrict network access from untrusted sources.\n\n\n\nCisco would like to thank Mr. Gregory Draperi for reporting this vulnerability.\n",
