An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted USB parameters to be processed by the kernel of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151204-nexus[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151204-nexus\"]",
