				"text": "A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco AsyncOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject a crafted HTTP header that could cause a web page redirection to a malicious website.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input before it is used as an HTTP header value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a crafted URL.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Glafkos Charalambous.\n\r\n\n\r\nProof-of-concept code that demonstrates an exploit of this vulnerability is publicly available.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists. Proof-of-concept exploit code is publicly available.",
