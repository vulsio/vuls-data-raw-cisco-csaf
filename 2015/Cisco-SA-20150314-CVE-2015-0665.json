				"text": "A vulnerability in the inter-process communication (IPC) channel of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Hostscan module could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write and overwrite arbitrary files with elevated privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient path traversal protections in certain IPC commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPC messages. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to write or overwrite arbitrary files on the filesystem.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate and have local access to the targeted system. These requirements may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
