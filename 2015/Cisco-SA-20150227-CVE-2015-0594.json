				"text": "A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Common Services help pages could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface on the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters used by the help page system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the system to follow an attacker-supplied link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause arbitrary script or HTML code to be executed in the user's browser in the context of the affected site.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.\n",
