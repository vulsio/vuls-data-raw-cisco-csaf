An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enumerating scheduled meetings and downloading the host calendar for each meeting. \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must first be able to enumerate scheduled meetings from a targeted device, making exploitation more difficult in environments that restrict network access from untrusted sources.\n",
