				"text": "Cisco TelePresence VCS\r\nextends the benefits of face-to-face video collaboration across networks\r\nand organizations by supporting any-to-any video and telepresence\r\ncommunications.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Expressway is designed specifically for\r\ncomprehensive\r\ncollaboration services provided through Cisco Unified Communications\r\nManager, Cisco Business Edition, or Cisco Hosted Collaboration Solution.\r\nIt features established firewall-traversal technology and helps\r\nredefine traditional enterprise collaboration boundaries.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence Conductor simplifies multiparty video collaboration by orchestrating the allocation of conferencing resources for every user in a\r\nmeeting.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSDP Media Description Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the  Session Description Protocol (SDP) packet handler\r\nfunction  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a\r\nreload of the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to\r\nimproper handling of an exception when receiving crafted SDP packets. An\r\nattacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SDP\r\npackets to the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability can be triggered by SDP messages sent via UDP or\r\nTCP. Messages sent via Transport Layer Security (TLS) will also be affected.\r\nThe default ports for UDP and TCP deployments are UDP port 5060 and TCP\r\nport 5060. The default port for TLS deployment is TCP port 5061. This vulnerability can be triggered via IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) packets.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCus96593[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus96593\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence VCS and Cisco Expressway and Cisco bug ID CSCun73192[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun73192\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence Conductor.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0652.\n\r\n\n\r\nAuthentication Bypass Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the authentication\r\ncode  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the system\r\nlogin and successfully authenticate to the system.\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability is due to insufficient validation of parameters passed\r\nduring the login process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\r\nby sending a crafted request to the system. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the authentication\r\ncontrols and successfully log in to the system. An attacker would need to\r\nhave knowledge of a valid username. The attacker will receive the privilege of that user after logging in. This vulnerability could give the attacker administrative access to the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability can be exploited over HTTPS only and targeting the management interface of the affected system. A valid TCP handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability can be triggered via IPv4 and IPv6 packets.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCur02680[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCur02680\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence VCS and Cisco Expressway and Cisco bug ID CSCur05556[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCur05556\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence Conductor\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0653.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n",
