An attacker\r\ncould exploit\r\nthis vulnerability by sending such an IPv6 packet to an\r\naffected device that is configured to process IPv6 traffic. An exploit\r\ncould allow the attacker to cause a reload of the line card, resulting\r\nin a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150611-iosxr[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150611-iosxr\"]",

				"text": "A Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device is affected by this vulnerability when all the following conditions are met:\n\r\n\n\r\n1) Any of the following line cards are installed on the chassis:\n\r\n\r\n    CRS-MSC-140G: Cisco CRS-3 Modular Services Card (140G)\r\n    CRS-FP140: Cisco CRS-3 Forwarding Processor Card (140 Gbps)\r\n    CRS-LSP: Cisco CRS-3 Label Switch Processor \r\n\r\n2) The Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device is running a Cisco IOS XR release affected by this vulnerability. See the \"Software Versions and Fixes\" section of this advisory for information about affected releases. Note: Cisco IOS XR Software Releases 4.2.1 and later are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n3) Any previously listed line card is configured to process IPv6 traffic.\r\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show diag command to determine whether any of the affected line cards are installed on a Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device. The following output shows a Cisco CRS-3 Carrier Routing System device with a CRS-MSC-140G line card installed:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:router#sh diag\r\nThu Jun  4 14:53:25.229 EDT\r\n\r\nCARD 0/0/* : Cisco CRS Series Modular Services Card 140G\r\n  MAIN:  board type 500064\r\n         800-32942-06 rev B0\r\n         dev N/A\r\n         S/N SAX99999ZZZ\r\n  PCA:   73-12720-06 rev A0\r\n  PID:   CRS-MSC-140G\r\n  VID:   V03\r\n  CLEI:  IPUCAZYBAC\r\n  ECI:   180032\r\n\r\n\n \r\n\r\n\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show version command to determine the Cisco IOS XR release running on the device. A device running Cisco IOS XR will include the string \"Cisco IOS XR\" in the output of the show version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IOS XR Release 4.1.2:\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:router#sh version \r\nThu Jun  4 14:56:06.484 EDT\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XR Software, Version 4.1.2[Default]\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\n\r\nROM: System Bootstrap, Version 2.05(20110622:151317) [CRS ROMMON],  \r\n\r\nrouter uptime is 2 years, 11 weeks, 5 days, 10 hours, 22 minutes\r\n\r\nSystem image file is \"disk0:hfr-os-mbi-4.1.2.CSCtw71819-1.0.0/0x100008/mbihfr-rp-x86e.vm\"\r\n\r\ncisco CRS-16/S (Intel 686 F6M14S4) processor with 12582912K bytes of memory.\r\nIntel 686 F6M14S4 processor at 2130Mhz, Revision 2.174\r\n\r\nCisco CRS Series 16 Slots Line Card Chassis\r\n\n \r\n\r\n\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show ipv6 interface brief command to determine if an interface is enabled for IPv6 traffic processing. The following example shows an interface configured for IPv6 processing:\r\n\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:router# show ipv6 interface brief\r\n\r\n <!--output omitted-->\r\nGigabitEthernet0/2/0/0 [Up/Up]\r\nfe80::212:daff:fe62:c150\r\n202::1\r\n \r\n\r\n\n\r\nThe show ipv6 interface briefÂ command will produce an\r\nerror message if the running version of Cisco IOS XR Software does not\r\nsupport IPv6. The output will not show any interfaces with IPv6 addresses if\r\nIPv6 is disabled. \n\r\n\n\r\nAn interface may be configured for IPv6 processing but may not appear on the output of the show ipv6 interface brief command if the interface is part of a bundle or a virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instance. The show ipv6 vrf all interface command can be used to determine whether any interface has been configured in this way. The following is the output of the show ipv6 vrf all interface command showing an interface configured for IPv6 processing as part of a bundle and assigned to a VRF instance:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:router#sh ipv6 vrf all interface \r\nThu Jun  4 15:12:11.170 EDT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBundle-Ether4.765 is Up, ipv6 protocol is Up, Vrfid is FDA (0x60000001)\r\n  IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is fe80::21d:a2ff:aabb:ccdd\r\n  Global unicast address(es):\r\n    2001:db8:1:1::1, subnet is 2001:db8:1:1::/64 \r\n  Joined group address(es): ff02::1:ff00:0 ff02::1:aabb:ccdd ff02::2\r\n      ff02::1\r\n  MTU is 1518 (1500 is available to IPv6)\r\n  ICMP redirects are disabled\r\n  ICMP unreachables are enabled\r\n  ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts 1\r\n  ND reachable time is 0 milliseconds\r\n  ND advertised retransmit interval is 0 milliseconds\r\n  Hosts use stateless autoconfig for addresses.\r\n  Outgoing access list is not set\r\n  Inbound  access list is not set\r\n  Table Id is 0xe0800001\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
