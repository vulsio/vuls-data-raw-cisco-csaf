An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining the SSH private key and using it to connect to any WSAv, ESAv, or SMAv. An exploit could allow the attacker to access the system with the privileges of the root user.\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco bug IDs: \n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    For Cisco WSAv, the vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuu95988[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuu95988\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-4216.\r\n    For Cisco ESAv, the vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuu95994[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuu95994\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-4216.\r\n    For Cisco SMAv, the vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuu96630[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuu96630\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-4216.\r\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Virtual WSA, ESA, and SMA Default SSH Host Keys Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the remote support functionality of Cisco WSAv, Cisco ESAv, and Cisco SMAv Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to decrypt and impersonate secure communication between any virtual content security appliances. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the presence of default SSH host keys that are shared across all the installations of WSAv, ESAv, and SMAv. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining one of the SSH private keys and using it to impersonate or decrypt communication between any WSAv, ESAv, or SMAv. An exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt and impersonate secure communication between any virtual content security appliances.\n\r\n\n\r\nAt attacker with possession of compromised keys, who is able to intercept traffic between the WSAv or ESAv and a host it is communicating with, would be able to decrypt the communication with a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\r\n\n\r\nExploiting this vulnerability on Cisco SMAv is possible in all cases in which SMAv is used to manage any content security appliance. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability on Cisco SMAv allows an attacker to decrypt communication toward SMAv, impersonate SMAv, and send altered data to a configured content appliance. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability on a communication link toward any content security appliance that was ever managed by any SMAv.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco bug IDs: \n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    For Cisco WSAv, the vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCus29681[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCus29681\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-4217.\r\n    For Cisco ESAv, the vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuu95676[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuu95676\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-4217.\r\n    For SMAv, the vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuu96601[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuu96601\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-4217.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe fix, which is available at the time of the advisory publication, is provided in the form of an updater script patch.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis patch is required for all virtual appliance releases for email security, web security, and content security management that were downloaded or upgraded before June 25, 2015.\n\r\nThis patch is not required for physical hardware appliances or for virtual appliance downloads or upgrades after June 25, 2015.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe patch will delete all the preinstalled SSH keys on the appliance. After the key deletion, the patch will also provide customers with additional steps to take for a complete fix.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis patch will be available on all the virtual platforms via the standard upgrade mechanism. The patch appears in the list of upgrades as cisco-sa-20150625-ironport SSH Keys Vulnerability Fix and must be manually installed by using the CLI.  \n\r\n\n\r\nPlease refer to the release notes for a complete set of instructions:\r\n\r\n\r\n    http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/web-security-appliance/products-release-notes-list.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/web-security-appliance/products-release-notes-list.html\"] for WSAv\r\n    http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/email-security-appliance/products-release-notes-list.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/email-security-appliance/products-release-notes-list.html\"] for ESAv\r\n    http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/content-security-management-appliance/products-release-notes-list.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/content-security-management-appliance/products-release-notes-list.html\"] for SMAv\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: All affected images will be removed from the software downloads section of Cisco.com prior to publication of this advisory. WSAv, ESAv, or SMAv images will not be available for download. New images will be loaded in the following days, which will enable existing customers to continue with any planned updates and new customers to perform installations.\r\n",
