An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PMIPv6 packet to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial DoS condition because the hamgr process could restart when parsing the crafted PMIPv6 packet.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities not are available.\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151016-asrcdma[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151016-asrcdma\"]",
