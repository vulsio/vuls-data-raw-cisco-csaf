An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging into the device and escalating their privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to acquire root-level privileges and take full control of the device.\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151104-privmse[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151104-privmse\"]",
