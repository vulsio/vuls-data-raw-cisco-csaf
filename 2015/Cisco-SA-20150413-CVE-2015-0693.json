An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted pickle file to an affected device. A successful exploit could be used to conduct further attacks.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, no software updates are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must log in locally to the vulnerable device. The access requirement reduces the potential for exploitation.",
