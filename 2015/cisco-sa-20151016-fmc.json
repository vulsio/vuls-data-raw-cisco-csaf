An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by bypassing policy restrictions and executing commands on the underlying operating system. The user needs to log in to the device with valid administrator-level credentials.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151016-fmc[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151016-fmc\"]",
