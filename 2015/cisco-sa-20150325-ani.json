				"text": "Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) is a feature of Cisco IOS, which allows intelligent automatic device management by introducing self-management concepts that simplify network management for the network operator. The Autonomic Networking Infrastructure feature simplifies the network bootstrap functionality by removing the need for any kind of prestaging, thereby, allowing devices to join a domain securely, after which devices can be configured.\r\n\r\nAutonomic Networking Registration Authority Spoofing Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to spoof an Autonomic Networking Registration Authority (ANRA) response.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of an Autonomic Networking (AN) response message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted AN messages. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bootstrap a device into an untrusted autonomic domain, gaining limited command and control of the AN node, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition and disrupting access to the legitimate autonomic domain.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCup62191 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup62191\"] (registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-0635.\r\n\r\nAutonomic Networking Infrastructure Spoofed Autonomic Networking Messages Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service condition disrupting access to the autonomic domain from a specific Autonomic Networking (AN) node.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an overloaded AN message which can reset the finite state machine. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted AN messages that spoof an existing AN node. An exploit could allow the attacker to disrupt access to the autonomic domain from the spoofed node.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCup62293 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup62293\"] (registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0636.\r\n\r\nAutonomic Networking Infrastructure Device Reload Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Autonomic Networking Infrastructure (ANI) feature of Cisco IOS Software and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of received Autonomic Networking (AN) messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted AN messages that spoof the target device. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an affected system to reload and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCup62315 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup62315\"] (registered [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2015-0637.",

The Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"] allows customers to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system\r\nEnter show version command output for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a customized search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nThe tool identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a queried software release and the earliest release that corrects all vulnerabilities in each Cisco Security Advisory (\"First Fixed\"). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest possible release that corrects all vulnerabilities in all displayed advisories (\"Combined First Fixed\"). Please visit the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"] or enter a Cisco IOS Software release in the following field to determine whether the release is affected by any published Cisco IOS Software advisory.\r\n\r\n(Example entry: 15.1(4)M2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco IOS XE Software  Cisco IOS XE Software is affected by the vulnerabilities that are disclosed in this document.\r\n\r\n                               Cisco IOS XE Software Release                 First Fixed Release                   First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2015 Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication                                    2.5.x               Not vulnerable\r\n              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                   2.6.x               Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                   3.1.xS               Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                   3.1.xSG              Not vulnerable              Not vulnerable                                   3.2.xS               Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.2.xSE              Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.7.1E or later.                                   3.2.xSG              Not vulnerable              Not vulnerable                                  3.2.xXO              Not vulnerable              Not vulnerable                                  3.2.xSQ              Not vulnerable              Not vulnerable                                   3.3.xS               Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.3.xSE              Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.7.1E or later.                                  3.3.xSG              Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.7.1E or later.                                  3.3.xXO              Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.7.1E or later.                                  3.3.xSQ              Not vulnerable              Not vulnerable                                   3.4.xS               Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.4.xSG              Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.7.1E or later.                                  3.4.xSQ              Not vulnerable              Not vulnerable                                   3.5.xS               Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.5.xE              Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.7.1E or later.                                  3.6.xS               Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.6.xE              Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.7.1E or later.                                  3.7.xS              Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.7.xE              Not vulnerable              3.7.1E\r\n                                  3.8.xS              Not vulnerable\r\n              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.9.xS              Not vulnerable              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.10.xS              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.13.1S or later              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.11.xS              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.13.1S or later              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.12.xS              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.13.1S or later              Vulnerable; migrate to 3.12.3S or later.                                  3.13.xS              3.13.1S\r\n              3.13.2S\r\n                                  3.14.xS\r\n              Not vulnerable\r\n              Not vulnerable                                  3.15.xS\r\n              Not vulnerable              Not vulnerable\r\nCisco IOS XR Software  Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by any of the vulnerabilities that are disclosed in the March 2015 Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication",
