An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted network packets to the affected device.javascript:void(0);\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted network packets to the affected device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.\n",
