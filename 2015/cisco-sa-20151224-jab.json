				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Jabber client could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a STARTTLS downgrade attack. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the client does not verify that an Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) connection has been established with Transport Layer Security (TLS). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to tamper with the XMPP connection and avoid TLS negotiation. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the client to establish a cleartext XMPP connection.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151224-jab[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151224-jab\"]",
