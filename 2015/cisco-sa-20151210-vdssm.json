An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application, allowing them to access the internal database through the GUI or by crafting an HTTP request. An exploit could allow the attacker to have read and write access to sensitive information in the back-end database, which should be restricted.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151210-vdssm[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151210-vdssm\"]",
