An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by flooding an adjacent IOS XE device with specific ND messages. An exploit could allow the attacker to deplete the available memory, possibly causing an affected device to crash.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151214-ios[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151214-ios\"]",
