				"text": "A vulnerability in the anti-spam scanner of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the anti-spam functionality of the ESA.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper error handling of a malformed packet in the anti-spam scanner. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS Sender Policy Framework (SPF) text record. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the anti-spam scanner and generate a malformed packet alert.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150612-esa[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20150612-esa\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS versions through 9.6 for ESA, on both virtual and hardware appliances, that are configured to perform anti-spam scanning and SPF/Sender Identification Framework (SIDF) verification for mail flow.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether an ESA is configured to perform anti-spam scanning, use the GUI and navigate to Open Security services > IronPort Anti-Spam, and verify that IronPort Anti-Spam is enabled. \n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether SPF/SIDF is configured, use the GUI and navigate to Mail Polices > Mail Flow Policies. For each configured policy name, scroll down to Security Services > SPF/SIDF Verification and verify that SPF/SIDF verification is enabled.\n\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco ESA, administrators can use the version command in the ESA CLI. The following example shows the results for a device running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoesa> version\r\nCurrent Version\r\n===============\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance\r\nModel: X1070\r\nVersion: 8.5.3-051\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Cloud Email Security (CES) includes the Cisco ESA and Cisco Security Management Appliance (SMA) as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.",
