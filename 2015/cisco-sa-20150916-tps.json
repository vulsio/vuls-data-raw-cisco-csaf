An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted URL that is designed to trigger the overflow condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuu28277 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuu28277\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2015-6284.",
