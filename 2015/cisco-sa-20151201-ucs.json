An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a specific link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected system via a web browser with the privileges of the user.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151201-ucs[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151201-ucs\"]",
