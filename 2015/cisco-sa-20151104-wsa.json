An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing arbitrary commands as arguments to the affected fields of the web interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the underlying system with root-level privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
