An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing an HTTP request that triggers content rewriting. Depending on the configuration, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the appliance to crash or trigger an error recovery event.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
