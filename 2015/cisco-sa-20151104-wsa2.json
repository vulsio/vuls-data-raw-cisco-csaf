				"text": "A vulnerability in the file-range request functionality of Cisco AsyncOS for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an appliance because the appliance runs out of system memory.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to free memory when a file range is requested through the Cisco WSA. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening multiple connections that request file ranges through the WSA. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the WSA to stop passing traffic when enough memory is used and not freed.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. A workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is also available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\n\n\r\n http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151104-wsa2[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20151104-wsa2\"]",

The following example shows the results for an appliance running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 8.5.3-051:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscowsa> version\nCurrent Version\n===============\nProduct: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security Appliance\nModel: S670\nVersion: 8.5.3-051\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\n\r\nSee the \"Fixed Software\" section of this security advisory for more information about the affected versions.",

To determine whether there is an accumulation of connections, use the status detail command in the Cisco WSA CLI. The value of the Total client connections field may show a large number of connections, as shown in the following example:\n\r\n\r\n# status detail\r\nConnections:\r\n  Total client connections                   99999\r\n\n\r\nIf this condition is observed, the appliance may have been compromised by this vulnerability. In addition, any indication of memory exhaustion should be examined because this vulnerability is a memory leak.",
