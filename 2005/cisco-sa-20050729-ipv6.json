				"text": "Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOSÂ®)  Software is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) and potentially an  arbitrary code execution attack from a specifically crafted IPv6 packet. The  packet must be sent from a local network segment. Only devices that have been  explicitly configured to process IPv6 traffic are affected. Upon successful  exploitation, the device may reload or be open to further exploitation.\r\n  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20050729-ipv6 [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20050729-ipv6\"].",

				"text": "This issue affects all Cisco devices  running any unfixed version of Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XR code that supports,  and is configured for, IPv6. A system which supports IPv6, if not specifically  configured for IPv6, is not affected. You can use the show ipv6  interface command to determine whether IPv6 is enabled on a  system.\r\n\r\nSample output of the show ipv6  interface command is shown below for two systems, one not  configured for IPv6 and one configured for IPv6.\r\n\r\nAn empty output or  an error message will be displayed if IPv6 is disabled or unsupported on the  system.\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show ipv6 int fa 0/0\r\n  -here you see blank output\r\n\r\nIn the example below the system is vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show ipv6 interface\r\nSerial1/0 is up, line protocol is up    IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is FE80::A8BB:CCFF:FE00:D200    Global unicast address(es):      2001:1:33::3, subnet is 2001:1:33::/64     Joined group address(es):      FF02::1      FF02::1:FF00:3      FF02::1:FF00:D200    MTU is 1500 bytes    ICMP error messages limited to one every 100 milliseconds    ICMP redirects are enabled    ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts: 1    ND reachable time is 30000 milliseconds  Router#\r\n\r\nA router that has IPv6 enabled on a physical or logical  interface is vulnerable to this issue even if ipv6 unicast-routing is globally  disabled. The show ipv6 interface command can be  used to determine whether IPv6 is enabled on any interface.\r\n\r\n  Note:  Cisco 6500 and 7600 series systems that run 12.2(17a)SX,  12.2(17b)SXA or 12.2(17d)SXB based images automatically enable IPv6 on  interfaces where Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is enabled. MPLS is  enabled on an interface by the mpls ip or  tag-switching ip commands. You can use the  show ipv6 interface command to determine whether  IPv6 is enabled on any interface.\r\n\r\nTo determine the  software running on a Cisco product, log in to the device and issue the  show version command to display the system banner.  Cisco IOS Software will identify itself as \"Internetwork Operating System  Software\" or simply \"IOS.\" On the next line of output, the image name will be  displayed between parentheses, followed by \"Version\" and the IOS release name.  Other Cisco devices will not have the show version  command or will give different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows  a product running IOS release 12.3(6) with an image name of C2600-JS-MZ:\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Internetwork Operating System Software IOS (tm)\r\n  C2600 Software (C2600-JS-MZ), Version 12.3(6), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\n\r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS release naming can be  found at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"].\r\n\r\nA  system that is running a Cisco IOS XR version prior to 3.2 is also affected by  this vulnerability if configured for IPv6. The show ipv6  interface command can be used to identify whether IPv6 is enabled  on a system running Cisco IOS XR.",

				"text": "IPv6 is the \"Internet Protocol Version 6\", designed by the Internet  Engineering Task Force (IETF) to replace the current version Internet Protocol,  IP Version 4 (IPv4).\r\n\r\nA vulnerability exists in the processing of IPv6 packets. Crafted  packets from the local segment received on logical interfaces (that is, tunnels  including 6to4 tunnels) as well as physical interfaces can trigger this  vulnerability. Crafted packets can not traverse a 6to4 tunnel and attack a box  across the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe crafted packet must be sent from a local network segment to trigger  the attack. This vulnerability can not be exploited one or more hops from the  IOS device.\r\n\r\nThis issue is documented in Cisco bug ID  CSCef68324 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCef68324\"]  (  registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)  for Cisco IOS, and  CSCeh74956 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCeh74956\"]  (  registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)  for Cisco IOS XR.",

				"text": "The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer  situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and  organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,  customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to  ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended  network before it is deployed.\r\n\r\nIn networks where IPv6 is not needed but enabled, disabling IPv6  processing on an IOS device will eliminate exposure to this vulnerability. On a  router which is configured for IPv6, this must be done by issuing the command  no ipv6 enable and no ipv6  address on each interface.",

A device running a  release in the given train that is earlier than the release in a specific  column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable.

On a  router which is configured for IPv6, this must be done by issuing the command  no ipv6 enable and no ipv6  address on each interface."
