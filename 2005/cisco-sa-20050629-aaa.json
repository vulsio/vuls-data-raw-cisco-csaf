				"text": "Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) network security  services provide the primary framework through which access control is set up  on a device.\r\n\r\nAAA authentication services are used to control access to different  services on a system. Multiple AAA authentication services can be configured on  a system to fall back to a backup authentication method in case the primary  authentication method is unavailable.\r\n\r\nAAA authentication can be used for different purposes (controlling  access to the routers, authenticating remote subscribers etc.).\r\n\r\nRefer to the following URL for more information on AAA:  http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios122/122cgcr/fsecur_c/fsaaa/index.htm [\"http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios122/122cgcr/fsecur_c/fsaaa/index.htm\"]\r\n\r\nRemote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) is defined in  RFC2865 and describes a protocol for carrying authentication, authorization,  and configuration information.\r\n\r\nThere is a vulnerability in AAA RADIUS authentication if  none is used as a fallback method. Sending a sufficiently long  username will bypass the RADIUS authentication and succeed.\r\n\r\nFollowing algorithm can be used to determine whether a configuration is  vulnerable:\r\n\r\n  1. Are you using an affected version of IOS?\r\n\r\n  No: You are not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n  Yes: Go to step 2.\r\n\r\n  2. Is AAA RADIUS Authentication  used?\r\n\r\n  No: You are not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n  Yes: Go to step 3.\r\n\r\n  3. Is none used as an alternative to  RADIUS?\r\n\r\n  No: You are not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n  Yes: Go to step 4.\r\n\r\n  4. Is there any other method between  RADIUS and none?\r\n\r\n  No: You are vulnerable.\r\n\r\n  Yes: Go to step 5.\r\n\r\n  5. Is the other authentication method  local?\r\n\r\n  No: You are not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n  Yes: Go to step 4.\r\n\r\nBased on the algorithm above sample affected and unaffected  configurations are given below.\r\n\r\n\r\naaa authentication login xxxxxx group radius none (This is an affected configuration)\r\n\r\n\r\naaa authentication login xxxxxx group radius local none (This is an affected configuration)\r\n\r\n\r\naaa authentication login xxxxxx group radius group tacacs+ none (This is an unaffected configuration)\r\n\r\n\r\naaa authentication login xxxxxx group radius enable none (This is an unaffected configuration)\r\n\r\n\r\naaa authentication login xxxxxx group radius line none (This is an unaffected configuration)\r\n\r\n\r\naaa authentication login xxxxxx group radius local line none (This is an unaffected configuration)\r\n\r\nRemoving the none fallback method or putting at least  one additional method other than local between  RADIUS and none will mitigate this  vulnerability.",

				"text": "The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer  situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and  organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,  customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to  ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended  network before it is deployed.\r\n\r\n      Removing none as a fallback to      RADIUS or putting an additional method other than      local between RADIUS and      none will mitigate this vulnerability.\r\nFor example, an affected system which has a configuration similar to      the following aaa authentication login xxxxxx group radius      none can be changed to one of the followingaaa      authentication login xxxxxx group radius      aaa      authentication login xxxxxx group radius      enable      aaa authentication login xxxxxx group      radius enable none      aaa authentication login      xxxxxx group radius line none as a workaround.\r\n      Warning:  Removing none as a fallback      method may create problems if the RADIUS server becomes unavailable. With a      none fallback in place, all authentication requests will succeed when the      RADIUS server is unavailable. Removing none fallback method or replacing it      with enable or another mechanism may result in authentication failure if RADIUS      server becomes unavailable.",

Due to the variety of affected products and releases,  customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to  ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended  network before it is deployed.\r\n\r\n      Removing none as a fallback to      RADIUS or putting an additional method other than      local between RADIUS and      none will mitigate this vulnerability.\r\nFor example, an affected system which has a configuration similar to      the following aaa authentication login xxxxxx group radius      none can be changed to one of the followingaaa      authentication login xxxxxx group radius      aaa      authentication login xxxxxx group radius      enable      aaa authentication login xxxxxx group      radius enable none      aaa authentication login      xxxxxx group radius line none as a workaround.\r\n      Warning:  Removing none as a fallback      method may create problems if the RADIUS server becomes unavailable. With a      none fallback in place, all authentication requests will succeed when the      RADIUS server is unavailable. Removing none fallback method or replacing it      with enable or another mechanism may result in authentication failure if RADIUS      server becomes unavailable."
