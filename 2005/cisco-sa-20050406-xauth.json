				"text": "IPSec is a framework of open standards that provides data  confidentiality, data integrity, and data authentication between participating  peers. IPSec provides these security services at the IP layer allowing for data  to be transmitted across a public network without fear of observation,  modification, or spoofing, thus enabling applications such as Virtual Private  Networks (VPNs). IPSec uses the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol to provide  authentication of the IPSec peers, negotiate IPSec security associations (SA),  and establish IPSec keys.\r\n\r\n Extended Authentication (XAUTH) is an extension to IKE defined in an  expired Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Internet Draft,  draft-ietf-ipsec-isakmp-xauth-06.txt, which allows for organizations to utilize  existing legacy authentication methods in order to manage remote access.\r\n\r\n Successful VPN establishment consists of two levels of SA's known as  phases. Phase 1 authentication establishes session keys. Using the Xauth  feature, the client waits for a \"username/password\" challenge after the IKE  Phase 1 SA has been established. When the end user responds to the challenge,  the response is forwarded to the IPsec peers for an additional level of  authentication.\r\n\r\nThe    Cisco IOS Easy VPN Server feature [\"/en/US/products/sw/iosswrel/ps1839/products_feature_guides_list.html\"] introduced in IOS 12.2(8)T allows an  IOS device to act as a VPN concentrator, providing authentication and encrypted  access to network resources.\r\n\r\nTo determine if Cisco's Easy VPN Server XAUTH feature is enabled, check  the device's configuration for the following line:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n  crypto map <mapname> client authentication list <listname>\r\n\r\n The Easy VPN Server XAUTH feature may also be enabled underneath an  ISAKMP profile via a configuration similar to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n  crypto isakmp profile <profilename>      match identity group <groupname>     client authentication list <listname>     isakmp authentication list <listname>     client configuration address respond     qos-group 2\r\n\r\nCertain packets sent to the IOS Easy VPN Server listening on User  Datgram Protocol (UDP) port 500 may permit an unauthorized user to complete  Xauth authentication and thereby gain access to network resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order for the attack to succeed, an attacker must know the shared  group key to complete the IKE Phase 1 negotiation before the Xauth negotiation  takes place.\r\n\r\n This malformed packet vulnerability is documented as Cisco Bug ID    CSCin82407.  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCin82407\"] (  registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] )  customers only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A second vulnerability exists in a feature introduced in IOS 12.3(8)T  where an ISAKMP profile can be assigned to a remote access peer based on the  certificate the peer uses during IKE negotiation. If the ISAKMP profile  mandates XAUTH (AAA authentication and authorization lists are configured in  the profile), then the peer must perform XAUTH authentication after Phase 1  negotiation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n A vulnerability exists where the ISAKMP profile is assigned but the  attributes that are configured in the ISAKMP profile are not processed. This  can result in a situtation where both the VPN client and VPN server are  expecting to hear something from the other end of the connection. Normally this  deadlock will be broken by idle timers tearing down the SA, but it is possible  for a malicious client to propose Phase 2 negotiation during this time which  may allow for the IPSec SA to be fully established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n This issue only affects ISAKMP profiles matched by certificate maps.  Configurations with certificate maps configured will contain the commands:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n  crypto isakmp profile <profilename>      match certificate <mapname>\r\n\r\n This vulnerability is documented as Cisco Bug ID    CSCeg00277.  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCeg00277\"] (  registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] )  customers only.",

Due to the variety of affected products and releases,  customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to  ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended  network before it is deployed.\r\n     Using Strong Group Passwords\r\nBecause the preshared group password (also referred to as the group  key) must be known by an attacker, the use of a best practice to deploy strong  preshared group keys may mitigate a brute-force attack against this group  key.\r\n\r\nThe preshared key can be changed by using the following configuration  commands:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n      Router(config)#crypto isakmp client configuration group <group-name>       Router(config)#key <key>",

A device  running a release in the given train that is earlier than the release in a  specific column (less than the First Fixed Release) is known to be vulnerable.
