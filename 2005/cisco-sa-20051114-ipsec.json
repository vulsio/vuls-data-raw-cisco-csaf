For example, the Cisco VPNSM or VPN SPA are not required for the  device to be vulnerable.\r\n\r\n   Cisco IOS versions based on 12.2SXD, 12.3T, 12.4 and 12.4T\r\n\r\n   Cisco PIX Firewall versions up to but not including 6.3(5)\r\n\r\n   Cisco PIX Firewall/ASA versions up to but not including 7.0.1.4\r\n\r\n   Cisco Firewall Services Module (FWSM) versions up to but not including 2.3(3)\r\n\r\n   Cisco VPN 3000 Series Concentrators versions up to but not including 4.1(7)H and 4.7(2)B\r\n\r\n   Cisco MDS Series SanOS versions up to but not including 2.1(2)\r\n\r\n   Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers up to and including 3.2.78.0 with Crypto Accelerator present.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine the software running on a Cisco IOS product, log in to the  device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. Cisco  IOS software will identify itself as \"Internetwork Operating System Software\"  or simply \"IOS.\" On the next line of output, the image name will be displayed  between parentheses, followed by \"Version\" and the Cisco IOS release name.  Other Cisco devices will not have the show version command, or will give  different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco 7200 router running Cisco IOS  release 12.3(10a) with an installed image name of C7200-JO3S-M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nRouter# show version Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software  IOS (tm) 7200 Software (C7200-JO3S-M), Version 12.3(10a), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2) Copyright (c) 1986-2004 by cisco Systems, Inc.\r\n\r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS release naming can be found at  http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html\"].\r\n\r\nOnly Cisco IOS images that contain the Crypto Feature Set contain the  vulnerable IPSec code. Customers that are not running an IOS image with crypto  support are not exposed to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS feature set naming indicates that IOS images with crypto  support will have 'K8' or 'K9' in the feature designator field.\r\n\r\nFor example, the image in the example above, C7200-JO3S-M, does not  contain 'K8' or 'K9.' This indicates that this image does not support crypto,  and is therefore not vulnerable to the issues described in this Security  Advisory.\r\n\r\nThe following output was taken from a device that is running an IOS  image with crypto support:\r\n\r\n\r\n\nCisco Internetwork Operating System Software  IOS (tm) c6sup2_rp Software (c6sup2_rp-PK9S-M), Version 12.2(18)SXD5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3) Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport Copyright (c) 1986-2005 by cisco Systems, Inc. Compiled Fri 13-May-05 21:12 by ssearch\r\n\r\nSince the feature set designator (PK9S) contains 'K9', we can quickly  determine that this feature set contains crypto support.",

				"text": "IP Security, or IPSec, is a set of protocols standardized by the IETF  to support encrypted and/or authenticated transmission of IP packets. IPSec is  a protocol commonly used in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).\r\n\r\nThe Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol is used to negotiate keying  material for IPSec Security Associations (SAs) and provides authentication of  peers.\r\n\r\nFor more complete information on IPSec, consult IETF Request For  Comments (RFCs) 2401:\r\n\r\n http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2401.txt [\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2401.txt\"]\r\n\r\nFor more complete information on IKE, consult IETF Request For Comments  (RFCs) 2408 and 2409:\r\n\r\n http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2408.txt [\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2408.txt\"]\r\n\r\n http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2409.txt [\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2409.txt\"]\r\n\r\nIPSec is used in two general cases.\r\n\r\nThe first case is LAN-to-LAN VPN operation in which two devices  negotiate an IPSec connection between them for the purposes of connecting two  remote LANs via an IPSec tunnel. In this case the devices negotiating the IPSec  connection generally have static IP addresses, and the IPSec tunnel is up as  long as there is traffic that needs to traverse the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe second case is a Remote Access (RA) VPN which is typically used to  allow remote clients a connection to a secure network or service. A common  example of this is a user connecting to a corporate network while away from the  office. In this scenario, the remote user could be connecting from anywhere,  and their IP address is not static, but rather dynamically assigned via the  transport provider.\r\n\r\nIKE is not a requirement for the establishment of IPSec connections.  Depending on your requirements and the devices involved, it may be possible to  statically configure the SA information and disable IKE. This type of  configuration may not be possible in the case of RA VPNs due to the user's IP  address being unknown prior to the establishment of the IPSec connection. See  the Workarounds Section for more information.\r\n\r\nThe PROTOS test suite for IPSec is designed to test the design limits  of IPSec implementations by sending malformed IKE messages to the target  device.\r\n\r\nWhen receiving certain malformed packets, vulnerable Cisco devices may  reset, causing a temporary Denial of Service (DoS).\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities identified can be easily and repeatedly reproduced  with the use of the OUSPG \"PROTOS\" Test Suite for IKE. This suite is designed  to test the design limits of implementations that process IKE messages.\r\n     Additional Details for Cisco IOS\r\nThe vulnerabilities addressed by this Advisory were introduced in IOS  version 12.3(4)T, and are present in versions of 12.3T, 12.4, 12.4T, and  12.2SXD.\r\n\r\nPrior to IOS version 12.3(8)T, IKE was enabled by default, with no  crypto configuration needed for the IOS device to process IKE messages.\r\n\r\n12.2SXD versions of Cisco IOS have IKE enabled by default. To ensure  that IKE processing is disabled, enter the global configuration command  no crypto isakmp enable.\r\n\r\nAs of IOS version 12.3(8)T (which includes all 12.4-based versions),  crypto configuration is required to enable IKE message processing.\r\n\r\nIn order for an IOS device to process IKE packets, a crypto map must be  configured and applied to an interface.\r\n     Additional Details for Cisco PIX\r\nThe Cisco PIX does not enable IKE processing by default in any versions  of software.\r\n\r\nFor Cisco PIX versions prior to 7.0, use the following to determine if  IKE message processing is enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\n\nshow isakmp enable\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output when IKE is enabled on the  outside interface:\r\n\r\n\r\n\npixfirewall(config)# show isakmp enable isakmp enable outside\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output when IKE is not enabled on any  interface:\r\n\r\n\r\n\npixfirewall(config)# show isakmp pixfirewall(config)#\r\n\r\nFor Cisco PIX/ASA versions 7.0 and later, IKE is enabled only if the  following command is in the device configuration:\r\n\r\n\r\n\nisakmp enable\r\n      Additional Details for Cisco Wireless LAN controllers\r\nThe Cisco Wireless LAN controllers do not enable IKE message processing  by default in any versions of software and requires a Crypto Accelerator card  to be present in the controller to allow configuration of IPsec and IKE message  processing.\r\n\r\nTo determine if IKE message processing is enabled from the CLI prompt  issue the command:\r\n\r\n\r\nshow wlan <wlan identifier>\n\r\n\r\nIn a system where IKE message processing is enabled, IP Security field  will be marked \"Enabled\" and IKE configuration information will be present in  the show wlan <wlan ID> output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output when IKE message processing is  enabled on WLAN 1:\r\n\r\n\r\n(WLC) >show wlan 1\n WLAN Identifier.................................. 1 Network Name (SSID).............................. mobile Status...........................................

				"text": "The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer  situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and  organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,  customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to  ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended  network before it is deployed.\r\n\r\nFor customers that use IPSec, but do not require IKE for connection  establishment, IPSec connection information may be able to be entered manually,  and IKE can be disabled, eliminating the exposure.\r\n\r\nNote: Due to the potential complexity of configuring IPSec information,  this is likely not a viable alternative for most customers, but is mentioned  here for completeness. Please consult your product documentation for further  information on static IPSec configuration.\r\n     Restricting IKE Messages\r\nIt is possible to mitigate the effects of this vulnerability by  restricting the devices that can send IKE traffic to your IPSec devices. Due to  the potential for IKE traffic to come from a spoofed source address, a  combination of Access Control Lists (ACLs) and anti-spoofing mechanisms will be  most effective.\r\n     Anti-spoofing\r\nThe Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF) feature helps to  mitigate problems that are caused by spoofed IP source addresses. It is  available on Cisco routers and firewalls. For further details, please refer  to:\r\n\r\n http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios122/122cgcr/fsecur_c/fothersf/scfrpf.htm [\"/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/security/configuration/guide/scfrpf.html\"]\r\n\r\nBy enabling Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), all spoofed packets  will be dropped at the first device. To enable uRPF, use the following  commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nrouter(config)# ip cef  router(config)# interface <interface #>  router(config-if)# ip verify unicast reverse-path\r\n      Infrastructure Access Control Lists\r\n Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your  network, it is possible to identify traffic which should never be allowed to  target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of your  network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a network security best practice  and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as  well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The white paper  \"Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists\" presents  guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for infrastructure protection  ACLs: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html [\"/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"].",

Infrastructure ACLs are considered a network security best practice  and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as  well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The white paper  \"Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists\" presents  guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for infrastructure protection  ACLs: http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html [\"/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"]."
