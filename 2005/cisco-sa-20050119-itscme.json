Due to the variety of affected products and releases,\n\t customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to\n\t ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended\n\t network before it is deployed.\r\n \n  Affected devices that must run ITS, CME or SRST are vulnerable, and\n\t there are not any specific configurations that can be used to protect them.\n\t Applying access lists on interfaces that should not accept ITS, CME or SRST\n\t traffic and putting firewalls in strategic locations may greatly reduce\n\t exposure until an upgrade can be performed.\r\n \n  The IP Telephony Security in Depth SAFE paper at the URL below\n\t discusses a variety of best practices that should keep your voice network\n\t isolated from the Internet. These best practices may help to reduce the risk of\n\t exposure, although attacks from within the local network should always be\n\t considered a potential risk.\r\n \n  \nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns171/ns128/networking_solutions_white_papers_list.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns744/networking_solutions_program_home.html\"]\n\r\n\n  \n\nUsing 'strict-match' \n  It is possible to restrict SCCP communications to the IP specified in\n\t the ip source-address configuration command by using\n\t the \nstrict-match\n option. More\n\t information on this command can be found at the following URL:\r\n \n  \nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns165/ns391/networking_solutions_design_guidance09186a00801f8e30.html#wp40333[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns165/ns391/networking_solutions_design_guidance09186a00801f8e30.html#wp40333\"]\n\r\n\n  \n\nUsing Access Lists \n   Where possible, it is recommended to block SCCP traffic at the network\n\t edge with an Infrastructure Access Control List (iACL) or a Transit Access\n\t Control List (tACL).\r\n \n   For more information on iACLs, refer to \"Protecting Your Core:\n\t Infrastructure Protecton Access Control Lists\":\r\n \n  \nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html[\"/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"]\n\r\n\n  \n   For more information on tACLs, refer to 'Transit Access Control Lists:\n\t Filtering at Your Edge\":\r\n \n  \nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/tacl.html[\"/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml\"]\n\r\n\n  \n   Below is an example of an access list to block SCCP traffic from\n\t anywhere but a permitted network.\r\n \n   \n\t \nNote:  In SRST deployments the SCCP packets are not addressed directly to\n\t\tthe SRST device. The SCCP packets will be addressed to the call control devices\n\t\t(typically Cisco CallManager). \r\n \n   \n   In this example, the permitted telephony devices are on the\n\t 172.16.0.0/16 network and the SCCP port being used is the default, TCP port\n\t 2000. If the specific IP addresses of the telephony devices are known, then the\n\t access list can be made to restrict traffic from only those devices.\r\n \n  \n\n\n!--- Permit access from any IP address in the 172.16.0.0/16 \n!--- to TCP port 2000.\n\n\naccess-list 101 permit tcp 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 any eq 2000\n\n\n!--- Deny all traffic to port 2000.\n\n\naccess-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 2000\n\n\n!--- Permit all other traffic.\n\n\naccess-list 101 permit ip any any\n \n\nUsing Control Plane Policing \n   The Control Plane Policing (CoPP) feature may be used to mitigate this\n\t vulnerability. In the following example SCCP traffic is permitted to and from\n\t the 192.168.10.0/24 subnet. All other TCP port 2000 traffic destined to the\n\t device is blocked.\r\n \n  \naccess-list 140 deny   tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 2000\naccess-list 140 deny   tcp any 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 2000\naccess-list 140 permit tcp any any eq 2000\naccess-list 140 deny   ip  any any\n\nclass-map match-all sccp-class\n  match access-group 140\n\npolicy-map control-plane-policy\n  class sccp-class\n\n     police 8000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action drop\n\ncontrol-plane\n service-policy input control-plane-policy\n\n \n   CoPP is available in IOS release trains 12.2S and 12.3T.

					"details": "\n\n\n\n\n \n  The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer\n\t situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and\n\t organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,\n\t customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to\n\t ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended\n\t network before it is deployed.\r\n \n  Affected devices that must run ITS, CME or SRST are vulnerable, and\n\t there are not any specific configurations that can be used to protect them.\n\t Applying access lists on interfaces that should not accept ITS, CME or SRST\n\t traffic and putting firewalls in strategic locations may greatly reduce\n\t exposure until an upgrade can be performed.\r\n \n  The IP Telephony Security in Depth SAFE paper at the URL below\n\t discusses a variety of best practices that should keep your voice network\n\t isolated from the Internet. These best practices may help to reduce the risk of\n\t exposure, although attacks from within the local network should always be\n\t considered a potential risk.\r\n \n  \nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns171/ns128/networking_solutions_white_papers_list.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns744/networking_solutions_program_home.html\"]\n\r\n\n  \n\nUsing 'strict-match' \n  It is possible to restrict SCCP communications to the IP specified in\n\t the ip source-address configuration command by using\n\t the \nstrict-match\n option. More\n\t information on this command can be found at the following URL:\r\n \n  \nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns165/ns391/networking_solutions_design_guidance09186a00801f8e30.html#wp40333[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/netsol/ns340/ns394/ns165/ns391/networking_solutions_design_guidance09186a00801f8e30.html#wp40333\"]\n\r\n\n  \n\nUsing Access Lists \n   Where possible, it is recommended to block SCCP traffic at the network\n\t edge with an Infrastructure Access Control List (iACL) or a Transit Access\n\t Control List (tACL).\r\n \n   For more information on iACLs, refer to \"Protecting Your Core:\n\t Infrastructure Protecton Access Control Lists\":\r\n \n  \nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/iacl.html[\"/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"]\n\r\n\n  \n   For more information on tACLs, refer to 'Transit Access Control Lists:\n\t Filtering at Your Edge\":\r\n \n  \nhttp://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/tacl.html[\"/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml\"]\n\r\n\n  \n   Below is an example of an access list to block SCCP traffic from\n\t anywhere but a permitted network.\r\n \n   \n\t \nNote:  In SRST deployments the SCCP packets are not addressed directly to\n\t\tthe SRST device. The SCCP packets will be addressed to the call control devices\n\t\t(typically Cisco CallManager). \r\n \n   \n   In this example, the permitted telephony devices are on the\n\t 172.16.0.0/16 network and the SCCP port being used is the default, TCP port\n\t 2000. If the specific IP addresses of the telephony devices are known, then the\n\t access list can be made to restrict traffic from only those devices.\r\n \n  \n\n\n!--- Permit access from any IP address in the 172.16.0.0/16 \n!--- to TCP port 2000.\n\n\naccess-list 101 permit tcp 172.16.0.0 0.0.255.255 any eq 2000\n\n\n!--- Deny all traffic to port 2000.\n\n\naccess-list 101 deny tcp any any eq 2000\n\n\n!--- Permit all other traffic.\n\n\naccess-list 101 permit ip any any\n \n\nUsing Control Plane Policing \n   The Control Plane Policing (CoPP) feature may be used to mitigate this\n\t vulnerability. In the following example SCCP traffic is permitted to and from\n\t the 192.168.10.0/24 subnet. All other TCP port 2000 traffic destined to the\n\t device is blocked.\r\n \n  \naccess-list 140 deny   tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 2000\naccess-list 140 deny   tcp any 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 eq 2000\naccess-list 140 permit tcp any any eq 2000\naccess-list 140 deny   ip  any any\n\nclass-map match-all sccp-class\n  match access-group 140\n\npolicy-map control-plane-policy\n  class sccp-class\n\n     police 8000 1500 1500 conform-action drop exceed-action drop\n\ncontrol-plane\n service-policy input control-plane-policy\n\n \n   CoPP is available in IOS release trains 12.2S and 12.3T. Additional\n\t information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found at\n\t the following URL:\r\n \n  \n\t http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html\"]\n\r\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n"
