				"text": "\n\n\n\n \n   These issues affect any Cisco device running an unfixed version of\n\t Cisco IOS that supports, and is configured to use, the SSH server\n\t functionality. \r\n \n   To determine the software running on a Cisco product, log in to the\n\t device and issue the show version command to display\n\t the system banner. Cisco IOS Software will identify itself as \"Internetwork\n\t Operating System Software\" or simply \"IOS.\" The image name will be displayed\n\t between parentheses shortly after this identification (possibly in the next\n\t line), followed by \"Version\" and the IOS release name. Other Cisco devices will\n\t not have the show version command or will give\n\t different output. \r\n \n   The following example identifies a Cisco device running IOS release\n\t 12.2(15)T14 (release train label \"12.2T\") with an installed image name of\n\t C806-K9OSY6-M: \r\n \n  \n\nRouter1> show version\nCisco Internetwork Operating System Software\nIOS (tm) C806 Software (C806-K9OSY6-M), Version 12.2(15)T14, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc4)\n[...]\n \n   The next example shows a device running IOS release 12.3(10) (release\n\t train label \"12.3 mainline\") with an image name of C2600-IK9OS3-M: \r\n \n  \n\nRouter2> show version\nCisco Internetwork Operating System Software\nIOS (tm) C2600 Software (C2600-IK9O3S3-M), Version 12.3(10), RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc3)\n[...]\n \n   Additional information about Cisco IOS release naming can be found at\n\t http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/620/1.html\"].\n\t \r\n \n   SSH protocol was introduced in the following IOS release trains:\n\t \r\n  \n   \n\t  IOS 12.0S (SSH version 1) \n  \n   \n\t  IOS 12.1T (SSH version 1) \n  \n   \n\t  IOS 12.2 (SSH version 1) \n  \n   \n\t  IOS 12.2T (SSH version 1) \n  \n   \n\t  IOS 12.3T (SSH version 2) \n   \n   To determine if the IOS image that your IOS device is running supports\n\t the server side of the SSH protocol, whether it is enabled (if supported), and\n\t the SSH protocol version being used (if SSH is supported and enabled), use the\n\t show ip ssh command in global mode: \r\n \n  \n\nRouter> show ip ssh\nSSH Enabled - version 1.5\nAuthentication timeout: 120 secs; Authentication retries: 3\n\n \n   The previous output shows that SSH is enabled on this device and that\n\t the SSH protocol major version that is being supported is 1. Possible values\n\t for the SSH protocol version reported by IOS are: \r\n  \n   \n\t  1.5: only SSH protocol version 1 is enabled. \n  \n   \n\t  1.99: SSH protocol version 2 with SSH protocol version 1\n\t\tcompatibility enabled. \n  \n   \n\t  2.0: only SSH protocol version 2 is enabled. \n \n   \n   For more information about SSH versions in IOS, please check the\n\t following URL:\n\t http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gt_ssh2.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gt_ssh2.html\"].\n\t \r\n \n   \n\t \nNote:  SSH protocols versions 1 and 2 cannot interoperate, but usually a\n\t\tSSH server knows how to handle connections from clients using either version of\n\t\tthe protocol, but in most cases the server has to be explicitly configured to\n\t\tdo this. The latest revision of protocol version 1 is \"1.5\", which is\n\t\tdocumented in a now expired Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft.\n\t\t\r\n \n   \n   The show ip ssh command was introduced in\n\t IOS release 12.1(1)T. If this command is not available then the IOS image in\n\t use does not have SSH server support and therefore it is not vulnerable to the\n\t issues discussed in this advisory. \r\n \n   As you will see in the Details[\"#details\"]\n\t section, the behavior of the vulnerabilities described in this document can\n\t depend on the version of the SSH protocol that the IOS device is using.\n\t Therefore, it is important to use the show ip ssh\n\t command as shown above to obtain this information. \r\n \n   When the show ip ssh command is executed on\n\t an image that does not support SSH the following output will be generated:\n\t \r\n \n  \n\nRouter> show ip ssh\n                ^\n% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.\n\nRouter>\n \n   Finally, even if the release and image running on an IOS device\n\t support SSH, the SSH server may not be enabled. The following example shows the\n\t output from the show ip ssh command on a device that\n\t supports SSH but that does not have the SSH server enabled (note the \"SSH\n\t Disabled\" message): \r\n \n  \n\nRouter> show ip ssh\nSSH Disabled - version 1.5\n%Please create RSA keys to enable SSH.\nAuthentication timeout: 120 secs; Authentication retries: 3\nRouter>\n \n\n \n\n\n",

				"text": "\n\n\n\n \n \n   Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol that provides a secure, remote\n\t connection to a network device. There are currently two versions of the SSH\n\t protocol, SSH Version 1 and SSH Version 2, both of which are supported by Cisco\n\t IOS. The SSH server component of IOS identifies itself as version \"1.5\" if\n\t running only version 1.0 of the protocol, as version \"2.0\" if running only\n\t version 2 of the protocol, and as version \"1.99\" if running protocol version 2\n\t with fall-back to protocol version 1. \r\n \n   The SSH server feature of IOS enables a SSH client to make a secure,\n\t encrypted connection to a Cisco IOS device. This connection provides\n\t functionality that is similar to a telnet connection with the difference that\n\t all traffic between the server and the client, including authentication\n\t information, travels encrypted through the wires. \r\n \n   TACACS provides a way to centrally validate users attempting to gain\n\t access to servers, workstations, routers, switches, access servers, and other\n\t network devices. \r\n \n   The two vulnerabilities described in this document can cause denial of\n\t service (DoS) conditions that affect IOS devices configured to use the IOS SSH\n\t server feature for remote management. \r\n \n   The first vulnerability may cause a device to reload when the IOS\n\t device is configured to act as a SSH version 2 server and any of the following\n\t events occurs: \r\n  \n   \n\t  The device is configured to authenticate users against a TACACS+\n\t\tserver (via a command like aaa authentication login  group tacacs+ local) and the\n\t\taccount username includes a domain name. This condition does not apply to\n\t\tdevices configured to authenticate via different methods, like a RADIUS server\n\t\tor the local user database. \n  \n   \n\t  A new SSH session is in the authentication phase (the server is\n\t\twaiting for a username or password) and another, already logged-in user uses\n\t\tthe send command. This condition applies to any\n\t\tauthentication method, including TACACS+, RADIUS, and the local user database.\n\t\t\n  \n   \n\t  Logging of messages is being directed to a SSH session that is\n\t\talready established (through the terminal monitor\n\t\tcommand) and the SSH session to the IOS device terminates while the SSH server\n\t\tis still sending data to the client. This condition applies to any\n\t\tauthentication method, including TACACS+, RADIUS, and the local user database.\n\t\t\n   \n   This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco bug ID\n\t CSCed65778[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCed65778\"]\n           (\nregistered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)\n         -- Crash in SSHv2 due to TACACS+ username\n\t containing domain name. \r\n \n   \n\t \nNote:  this vulnerability affects SSH protocol version 2. SSH protocol\n\t\tversion 1 is not affected. \r\n \n   \n   The second vulnerability consists of a memory leak that happens when\n\t an IOS device is configured to authenticate SSH users against a TACACS+ server\n\t and the login fails due to an invalid username or password. This affects both\n\t SSH version 1 and version 2 connections. In the case of SSH version 2\n\t connections, the memory leak occurs even after a successful login. Please note\n\t that the device is not affected if users are being authenticated against a\n\t RADIUS server or the local user database. \r\n \n   The memory leak can be detected by running the command\n\t show tcp brief, like in the following example:\n\t \r\n \n  \n\nRouter# show tcp brief\nTCB       Local Address           Foreign Address        (state)\n637202B8  10.0.0.19.13294       172.16.112.29.49       ESTAB\n6371C978  10.0.0.19.13233       172.16.112.29.49       ESTAB\n636CB228  10.0.0.19.13041       172.16.112.29.49       CLOSEWAIT\n636B6900  10.0.0.19.12912       172.16.112.29.49       CLOSEWAIT\n63697548  10.0.0.19.12848       172.16.112.29.49       CLOSEWAIT\n63687930  10.0.0.19.12784       172.16.112.29.49       CLOSEWAIT\n635F4A80  10.0.0.19.12659       172.16.112.29.49       CLOSEWAIT\n \n   In the output above, those Transmission Control Blocks (TCBs) in the\n\t state CLOSEWAIT will not go away and represent memory leaks. Please note that\n\t only TCP connections with a foreign TCP port of 49 (the well-known port for\n\t TACACS) are relevant. \r\n \n   This vulnerability is documented in the Cisco bug ID\n\t CSCed65285[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCed65285\"]\n           (\nregistered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)\n         -- SSH leaks memory and buffers. \r\n \n \n\n\n \n\n",

				"text": "\n\n\n\n \n \n   The effectiveness of any workaround is dependent on specific customer\n\t situations such as product mix, network topology, traffic behavior, and\n\t organizational mission. Due to the variety of affected products and releases,\n\t customers should consult with their service provider or support organization to\n\t ensure any applied workaround is the most appropriate for use in the intended\n\t network before it is deployed. \r\n \n  \nMitigation Strategies \n   Not all of the mitigation strategies listed will work for all\n\t customers. Some of the workarounds listed are dependent on which versions and\n\t feature-sets of IOS you have in your network. \r\n \n \nConfiguring a VTY Access Class \n   It is possible to limit the exposure of the Cisco device by applying a\n\t VTY access class to permit only known, trusted hosts to connect to the device\n\t via SSH. \r\n \n   For more information on restricting traffic to VTYs, please consult:\n\t \r\n \n  \n\t http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/ipaddr/command/reference/1rfip1.html#wp1017389[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/ipaddr/command/reference/1rfip1.html#wp1017389\"].\n\t \r\n \n   The following example permits access to VTYs from the 192.168.1.0/24\n\t netblock and the single IP address 172.16.1.2 while denying access from\n\t anywhere else: \r\n \n  \n\nRouter(config)# access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255\nRouter(config)# access-list 1 permit host 172.16.1.2\nRouter(config)# line vty 0 4\nRouter(config-line)# access-class 1 in\n \n   Different Cisco platforms support different numbers of terminal lines.\n\t Check your device's configuration to determine the correct number of terminal\n\t lines for your platform. \r\n \n \nConfiguring Access Lists (ACLs) \n   In addition to configuring a VTY Access Class, it may be desirable to\n\t block all SSH traffic destined to your network infrastructure. \r\n \n   Telnet and reverse telnet should be blocked as part of a Transit ACL\n\t controlling all access to the trusted network. Transit ACLs are considered a\n\t network security best practice and should be considered as a long-term addition\n\t to good network security, as well as a workaround for this specific\n\t vulnerability. The white paper entitled \"Transit Access Control Lists:\n\t Filtering at Your Edge\" presents guidelines and recommended deployment\n\t techniques for transit ACLs: \r\n \n  \n\t http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801afc76.shtml\"]\n\t \r\n \n \nConfiguring Infrastructure Access Lists  (iACLs) \n   Although it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your\n\t network, it is possible to identify traffic which should never be allowed to\n\t target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of your\n\t network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a network security best practice\n\t and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as\n\t well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The white paper entitled\n\t \"Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists\" presents\n\t guidelines and recommended deployment techniques for infrastructure protection\n\t ACLs: \r\n \n  \n\t http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"]\n\t \r\n \n \nConfiguring Receive Access Lists (rACLs) \n   For distributed platforms, rACLs may be an option starting in Cisco\n\t IOS Software Versions 12.0(21)S2 for the 12000 series GSR and 12.0(24)S for the\n\t 7500 series. The receive access lists protect the device from harmful traffic\n\t before the traffic can impact the route processor. Receive path ACLs are\n\t considered a network security best practice, and should be considered as a\n\t long-term addition to good network security, as well as a workaround for this\n\t specific vulnerability. The CPU load is distributed to the line card processors\n\t and helps mitigate load on the main route processor. The white paper entitled\n\t \"GSR: Receive Access Control Lists\" will help identify and allow legitimate\n\t traffic to your device and deny all unwanted packets: \r\n \n  \n\t http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml\"]\n\t \r\n \n \nControl Plane Policing \n   The Control Plane Policy (CoPP) feature may be used to mitigate this\n\t vulnerability, as in the following example: \r\n \n  \n\n! Do not police SSH traffic from trusted hosts\naccess-list 140 deny   tcp host  any eq 22\naccess-list 140 deny   tcp host  any eq 22\n[...]\naccess-list 140 deny   tcp host  any eq 22\n! Trust an entire network if desired\naccess-list 140 deny   tcp   any eq 22\n! Police SSH traffic from untrusted hosts\naccess-list 140 permit tcp any any eq 22\n! Do not police any other type of traffic going to the router\naccess-list 140 deny   ip  any any\n!\nclass-map match-all ssh-class\n  match access-group 140\n!\npolicy-map control-plane-policy\n  ! Drop all traffic that matches the class \"ssh-class\"\n  class ssh-class\n     drop\n!\ncontrol-plane\n  service-policy input control-plane-policy\n \n   \n\t \nNote: CoPP is available only in IOS release trains 12.0S, 12.2S and 12.3T.\n\t\tAdditional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be\n\t\tfound at the following URL:\n\t\thttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html\"]\n\t\t\r\n \n   \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n",
