An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious arguments into vulnerable commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected system.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-nso [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-nso\"]",

The output of the command in the CLI is  similar to the following example, which shows Release 4.5.5.1 installed:\r\n\r\n\r\nadmin@ncs> show ncs-state version\r\nncs-state version 4.5.5.1\r\n[ok][2018-05-15 16:41:30]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\n  Customers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table.\r\n                                Cisco NSO Major Release              First Fixed Release                                   4.1               4.1.6.1                                   4.2               4.2.4.1                                   4.3               4.3.3.1                                   4.4               4.4.2.1\r\nThe software is available for download from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com by searching for ���Network Services Orchestrator��� or by clicking Browse All and navigating to Cloud and Systems Management > Service Management and Orchestration > Network Services Orchestrator.",
