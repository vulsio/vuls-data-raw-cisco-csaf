				"text": "A vulnerability in the application server of the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to malformed SIP INVITE traffic received on the CVP during communications with the Cisco Virtualized Voice Browser (VVB). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SIP INVITE traffic to the targeted appliance. An exploit could allow the attacker to impact the availability of services and data on the device, causing a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to upgrade contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the first column lists major releases of Cisco Unified CVP Software and the second column indicates the recommended release to install to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:\r\n                                Cisco Unified CVP Major Release               Fixed Release for Cisco Bug CSCve85840                                  10.5               Affected; migrate to 11.6                                  11.0              Affected; migrate to 11.6                                  11.5              Affected; migrate to 11.6                                  11.6              Not affected\r\n\r\nCustomers with active service contracts can download fixed software for major releases from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com by navigating to Downloads Home > Products > Customer Collaboration > Options for Contact Center Solutions > Unified Customer Voice Portal.",
