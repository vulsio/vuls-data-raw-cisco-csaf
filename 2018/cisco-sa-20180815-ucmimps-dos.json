				"text": "A vulnerability in the XCP Router service of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM & Presence Service (CUCM IM&P) and the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) and Expressway could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a temporary service outage for all IM&P users, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious IPv4 or IPv6 packet to an affected device on TCP port 7400. An exploit could allow the attacker to overread a buffer, resulting in a crash and restart of the XCP Router service.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180815-ucmimps-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180815-ucmimps-dos\"]",

Alternatively, administrators can view the Software version field by navigating to Status > System > Information.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdentifying the Cisco TelePresence VCS and Expressway Unified Communications mode\r\n\r\nTo identify the current Unified Communications mode on Cisco TelePresence VCS and Expressway, administrators can log in to the web-based GUI of the system and look for the current setting of the Unified Communications mode option under Configuration > Unified Communications > Configuration.",
