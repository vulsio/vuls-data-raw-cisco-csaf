				"text": "A vulnerability in the crypto engine of the Cisco Integrated Services Module for VPN (ISM-VPN) running Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of VPN traffic by the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted VPN traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to hang or crash, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-dos\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2018 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that have a Cisco ISM-VPN installed and are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco ISM-VPN is installed on a device, administrators can use the show crypto engine brief command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a Cisco 3900 Integrated Services Router that has a Cisco ISM-VPN installed:\r\n\r\n\r\nISR3900-ISM# show crypto engine brief\r\ncrypto engine name:  Virtual Private Network (VPN) Module\r\ncrypto engine type:  hardware\r\nState:  Enabled\r\nLocation:  slot 0\r\nProduct Name:  ISM VPN Accelerator     <<<<<<<<<================\r\nUBOOT Ver   :  U-Boot 1.1.1 - ISRG2-Crypto-Engine - Version 2.7 (Build time: Mar  7 2011 - 09:12:23)\r\nFirmware Ver:    User: shrtrive - View/Label: REVENTON_FW_COMMIT_IOS_051315 - Date: May 13 2015 - Time: 12:09:51\r\n\r\nHW State    :  READY\r\nCompression:  No\r\nDES:  Yes\r\n3 DES:  Yes\r\nAES CBC:  Yes (128,192,256)\r\nAES CNTR:  No\r\nMaximum buffer length:  4096\r\nMaximum DH index:  5120\r\nMaximum SA index:  5120\r\nMaximum Flow index:  10230\r\nMaximum RSA key size:  2048\r\n\r\ncrypto engine name:  Cisco VPN Software Implementation\r\ncrypto engine type:  software\r\nserial number:  1810917E\r\ncrypto engine state:  installed\r\ncrypto engine in slot:  N/A\r\nISR3900-ISM#\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\n  Cisco IOS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software release-for example, 15.1(4)M2-in the following field:",
