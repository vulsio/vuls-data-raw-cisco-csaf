This corruption will eventually cause a timer crash. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious reassociation events multiple times to the same AP in a short period of time, causing a DoS condition on the affected AP.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

Issue the show version | include IOS command, and then refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of a Cisco Access Point that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.3(3)JA12.\r\n\r\n\r\nAP# show version | include IOS\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, C1600 Software (AP1G2-K9W8-M),    Version 15.3(3)JA12, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)    AP#",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\nCisco has released fixed software that addresses this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:\r\n\r\ncisco-sa-20181017-wlc-gui-privesc [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-gui-privesc\"]: Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software GUI Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-20181017-ap-ft-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-ap-ft-dos\"]: Cisco IOS Access Points Software 802.11r Fast Transition Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-20181017-wlc-capwap-memory-leak [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-capwap-memory-leak\"]: Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-20181017-wlc-capwap-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-wlc-capwap-dos\"]: Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the table in this section.
