				"text": "On November 1st, 2018, Armis announced the presence of a Remote Code  Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Stack on Texas  Instruments (TI) chips CC2640 and CC2650. This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID of CVE-2018-16986.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a memory corruption condition that may occur when processing malformed BLE frames. An attacker in close proximity to an affected device that is actively scanning could exploit the issue by broadcasting malformed BLE frames.  A successful exploit may result in the attacker gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service condition on an affected device.\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181101-ap [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181101-ap\"]",

To determine if a device supports BLE, the administrator can issue the show controllers bleRadio 0 interface command. If the command is not recognized or the error message BLE not supported on this platform is displayed, the Access Point does not support BLE and is considered not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nap# show controllers bleRadio 0 interface\r\n% Unrecognized command\r\n\r\n\r\nap# show controllers bleRadio 0 interface\r\nBLE not supported on this platform\r\n\r\nDetermining if the Cisco Aironet Access Point with BLE Support is Vulnerable\r\nIf a Cisco Aironet Access Point does support BLE, it is only vulnerable if BLE is active and BLE scan mode is enabled (BLE scan mode is disabled by default). The administrator can issue the show controllers bleRadio 0 interface command and if the Device Status is Unknown the Access Point is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nap# show controllers bleRadio 0 interface\r\n\r\nActive BLE host interface       : /dev/ttyMSM1\r\nDevice Status                   : Unknown\r\nDevice resets                   : 0\r\nHeart beat status               : Off\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Aironet Access Points have BLE scan mode disabled by default. The administrator can issue show controllers bleRadio 0 timers and if the Scan timer status is Not Running, the Access Point is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nap# show controllers bleRadio 0 timers\r\n\r\nTimers\r\n------\r\nScan timer status       : Not Running\r\n\r\nIn addition, if the administrator issues the show controllers bleRadio 0 scan brief and there are no entries displayed, the Access Point is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nap# show controllers bleRadio 0 scan brief\r\nProfile MAC  RSSI(-dBm)  RSSI@1meter(-dBm)  Last-heard\r\n\r\nDetermining the BLE Status from the WLC Controller  The administrator can also issue the WLC controller command show advanced ble summary to get the BLE status of the Access Point from the WLC controller.\r\n\r\nwlc# show advanced ble summary\r\nGlobal BLE Mgmt Admin State: DOWN\r\nBLE summary for all APs\r\nAP Name                       Interface        Admin State  Operation State\r\n--------------------------    ---------        -----------  ---------------\r\nap1800i-r2sw1-te-1-0-11       Integrated       DOWN         Non Operational\r\nap3800i_r2-sw1-Te1-0-5        USB dongle       DOWN         Non Operational\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software release is running on a device, administrators can use the controller’s web interface or the CLI.\r\n\r\nTo use the web interface, do the following:\r\n\r\nIn a browser, log in to the controller’s web interface\r\nClick the Monitor tab\r\nClick Summary in the left pane\r\nUnder Controller Summary, the Software Version field shows the release number of the software that is currently running on the device\r\n\r\nTo use the CLI, log in to the controller via Telnet, issue the show sysinfo command, and then refer to the value in the Product Version field of the command output. The following example shows the command output for a device that is running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.7.106.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n(wlc)> show sysinfo\r\n\r\nManufacturer's Name..............................
