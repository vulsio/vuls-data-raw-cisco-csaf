				"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication for Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Desktop Platforms, Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software, and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to establish an authenticated AnyConnect session through an affected device running ASA or FTD Software. The authentication would need to be done by an unsuspecting third party.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because there is no mechanism for the ASA or FTD Software to detect that the authentication request originates from the AnyConnect client directly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link and authenticating using the company's Identity Provider (IdP). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to  hijack a valid authentication token and use that to establish an authenticated AnyConnect session through an affected device running ASA or FTD Software.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, and ASA Software and FTD Software configured for SAML 2.0-based SSO for AnyConnect Remote Access VPN that is running on the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\n3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISA)\r\nASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances\r\nASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls\r\nASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers\r\nAdaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)\r\nFirepower 2100 Series Security Appliance\r\nFirepower 4100 Series Security Appliance\r\nFirepower 9300 ASA Security Module\r\nFTD Virtual (FTDv)\r\n\r\nASA Software\r\n\r\nThe ASA Software is only vulnerable if running software version 9.7.1 or later.Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on a device, administrators can use the show version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.7(1)4:\r\nciscoasa# show version | include Version\r\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.7(1)4  Firepower Extensible Operating System Version 2.1(1.66)  Baseboard Management Controller (revision 0x1) Firmware Version: 2.4\r\n    Customers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software release in the table that appears in the login window or the upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.\r\n\r\nFTD Software\r\n\r\nThe FTD Software is only vulnerable if running software version 6.2.1 or later.Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show version\r\n  ------------------[ ftd ]-----------------------\r\nModel : Cisco Firepower 2130 Threat Defense (77) Version 6.2.2 (Build 81)\r\nUUID : 0cd3595a-7efa-11e7-aaa1-ee3989c8bf25\r\nRules update version : 2017-12-20-001-vrt\r\nVDB version : 290\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyConnect Software\r\n\r\nThe AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software is only vulnerable if running software version 4.4.00243 or later.\r\n\r\nASA and FTD Features\r\n\r\nThe ASA software and the FTD software are vulnerable only if all of the following features are configured:\r\n\r\nSAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP)\r\nSAML 2.0 Service Provider (SP)\r\nAnyConnect Remote Access VPN\r\n\r\nNote: SAML 2.0 for AnyConnect features are first supported as of ASA release 9.7.1, FTD release 6.2.1, and AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client release 4.4.00243.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine whether ASA or FTD is configured with a SAML 2.0 IdP, administrators can use the show webvpn saml idp CLI command. The following output shows an ASA configured with a SAML 2.0 IdP:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show webvpn saml idp\r\n saml idp my_domain_idp\r\nurl sign-in https://asa-dev.my.domain.com/idp/endpoint/HttpRedirect\r\nurl sign-out https://asa-dev.my.domain.com/idp/endpoint/HttpRedirect\r\ntrustpoint idp my_domain_trustpoint\r\ntrustpoint sp asa_trustpoint\r\n\r\nTo determine whether ASA or FTD is configured as SAML 2.0 SP, administrators can use the show running-config tunnel-group | include remote-access|webvpn-attributes|saml CLI command. The following output shows an ASA configured as SAML 2.0 SP:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config tunnel-group | include remote-access|webvpn-attributes|saml\r\ntunnel-group cloud_idp_onelogin type remote-access\r\ntunnel-group cloud_idp_onelogin webvpn-attributes\r\nauthentication saml\r\nsaml identity-provider my_domain_idp\r\n\r\nTo determine whether ASA or FTD is configured for AnyConnect Remote Access VPN, administrators can use the show running-config CLI command and consult the following table for vulnerable configurations.\r\n                                Feature              Vulnerable Configuration                                              AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (with client services)                            crypto ikev2 enable <interface_name> client-services port <port #>\r\nwebvpn\r\n anyconnect enable                                                AnyConnect IKEv2 Remote Access (without client services)                            crypto ikev2 enable <interface_name>\r\nwebvpn\r\n anyconnect enable                                                AnyConnect SSL VPN                            webvpn\r\n enable <interface_name>",

				"text": "The vulnerability described in this advisory originates from the dilemma that the head-end device that has the SAML 2.0-based SSO for AnyConnect feature  enabled has no way to verify that the authentication request came from the same machine that is running the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.\r\n\r\nThe fix for this vulnerability involves changes in both the head-end device's ASA software and the client-side's AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. This includes embedded browser functionality in the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. For a complete fix, both the head-end device and the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client must be upgraded.\r\n\r\nAs the fix for this vulnerability requires protocol adjustments, the ASA has no automatic backward compatibility between the behavior of a solution running software versions prior to the fix and the default behavior of solutions running software versions that do include the fix.\r\n\r\nFor a transition period, both the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client and ASA Software will support both methods. The AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client will automatically detect the correct behavior when talking to a head-end device. On the ASA side, the previous behavior will be disabled by default. The previous behavior can be enabled manually per Connection Profile (\"tunnel-group\") using the newly introduced saml external-browser command under webvpn-attributes.\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading an ASA that has the SAML 2.0-based SSO for AnyConnect feature enabled, the new behavior will be enforced after the upgrade. Customers who cannot upgrade their AnyConnect clients at the same time will need to re-enable the previous behavior manually by adding the saml external-browser command after the ASA upgrade has completed. Cisco recommends removing the saml external-browser command after all AnyConnect clients have been migrated.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the Important Notes section in the Release Notes for the Cisco ASA Series, 9.9(x) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/release/notes/asarn99.html#reference_wpd_32d_ybb\"], the About SSO and SAML 2.0 section in the Cisco ASA Series VPN CLI Configuration Guide, 9.9 [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/configuration/vpn/asa-99-vpn-config/webvpn-configure-users.html#concept_E4852D9DE2B44A469C4D9C31444BFB62\"], the AnyConnect 4.6.00362 New Features section in the Release Notes for Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, Release 4.6, [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect46/release/notes/b_Release_Notes_AnyConnect_4_6.html#reference_iwz_3kr_ycb\"] and the VPN Authentication Using SAML section in the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Administrator Guide, Release 4.6 [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect46/administration/guide/b_AnyConnect_Administrator_Guide_4-6/configure-vpn.html#reference_FE50F6515F3F41F085C733AF39C83275\"] for further information on the changed behavior.",
