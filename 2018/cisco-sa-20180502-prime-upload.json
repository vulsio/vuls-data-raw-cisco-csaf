An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted Java Server Pages (JSP) file to a specific folder using path traversal techniques and then executing that file remotely. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device with the privileges of the SYSTEM user.\r\n\r\nThe Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score for this vulnerability is: Base 9.8 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\"]\r\n\r\nThe Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Critical\r\nThe Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCvf32411\r\n  Cisco Prime Infrastructure Upload Servlet Path Traversal and Remote Code Execution Vulnerability  A vulnerability in the File Upload servlet of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to any directory of a vulnerable device and then execute those files.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters in the HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the affected application as an unprivileged user, uploading a crafted Java Server Pages (JSP) file to a specific folder using path traversal techniques and then executing that file remotely. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device with the privileges of the SYSTEM user.\r\n\r\nThe CVSS score for this vulnerability is:   Base 8.8 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\"]\r\n\r\nThe SIR for this vulnerability is: High\r\nThe Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCvf81727",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nIn the following tables, the left column lists major releases of Cisco software.
