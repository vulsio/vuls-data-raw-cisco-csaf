				"text": "A vulnerability in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper management of memory resources, referred to as a double free. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SNMP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must know the user credentials for the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-snmp-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-snmp-dos\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities.

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software, have been configured to be queried over SNMP, and have Network Address Translation (NAT) enabled.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Assessing the SNMP Configuration\r\nTo determine whether a device is configured for SNMP, administrators can use the show run | include snmp command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the show run | include snmp command on a device that is configured with both read-only and read-write community strings:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show run | include snmp\r\n  snmp-server community public RO  snmp-server community write RW\r\n    Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or similar text.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nios-xe-device# show version\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

				"text": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device via IP Version 4 or IP Version 6. Only traffic that is directed to an affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for an affected system. A community string is a password that is applied to a device to restrict both read-only and read-write access to SNMP data on a device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be chosen carefully to ensure that they are not trivial. They should also be changed at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, the strings should be changed when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the organization.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must know the user credentials for an affected system.",

				"text": "Administrators can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling the affected Management Information Base (MIB), in this case the NAT-MIB. To create or update a view entry and disable the NAT-MIB, administrators can log in to the device and use the snmp-server view global configuration command in the CLI, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\n!Standard VIEW and Security Exclusions\r\nsnmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP iso included  snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP internet included  snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpUsmMIB excluded  snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpVacmMIB excluded  snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP snmpCommunityMIB excluded  snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP ciscoMgmt.252 excluded  !End Standard View     !Advisory Specific Mappings  snmp-server view NO_BAD_SNMP mib-2.123 excluded\r\n\r\nTo apply the configuration to a community string, administrators can use the following command:\r\n\r\n\r\nsnmp-server community mycomm view NO_BAD_SNMP RO\r\n\r\nFor SNMP Version 3, administrators can use the following command:\r\n\r\n\r\nsnmp-server group v3group auth read NO_BAD_SNMP write NO_BAD_SNMP\r\n  SNMP Access Control List\r\nNote: Because the vulnerable feature uses UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat access control lists (ACLs) that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) should be considered in conjunction with ACLs to offer a better mitigation solution.  The following is an example of an ACL that allows only hosts at 192.0.2.1 to query the device with SNMP requests:\r\n\r\n\r\naccess-list 1 permit 192.0.2.1\r\nsnmp-server community example RO 1",
