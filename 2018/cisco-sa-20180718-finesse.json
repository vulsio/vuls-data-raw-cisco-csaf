				"text": "Two vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack or retrieve a cleartext password from an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n  Cisco Finesse HTTP Request Processing Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a Cisco Finesse server to submit an HTTP request to an arbitrary host. This type of attack is commonly referred to as a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for the Cisco Finesse API that supports gadgets integration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a maliciously crafted HTTP request to a Cisco Finesse server.\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0398\r\n\r\nThe Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium\r\n\r\nThe Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Base score for this vulnerability is: 5.8 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N\"]\r\n\r\nThe Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCvg71018 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg71018\"]\r\n  Cisco Finesse Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve a cleartext password from an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software prefills the Password field of the login form for the web-based management interface with a password that was previously saved and is stored in an internal database for the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by viewing the HTML source of a login form for the web-based management interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and retrieve a cleartext password from an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0399\r\n\r\nThe SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium\r\n\r\nThe CVSS Base score for this vulnerability is: 5.3 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\"]\r\n\r\nThe Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCvg71044 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg71044\"]",
