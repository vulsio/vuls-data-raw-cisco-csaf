				"text": "A vulnerability in the FTP server of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the FTP server of the device without a valid password. The attacker does need to have a valid username.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect FTP user credential validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using FTP to connect to the management IP address of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to log in to the FTP server of the Cisco WSA without having a valid password.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180307-wsa [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180307-wsa\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS for WSA Software on both virtual and hardware appliances that are running any release of Cisco AsyncOS 10.5.1 for WSA Software. See the Fixed Software [\"#Fixed\"] section of this security advisory for additional information about the affected software releases.\r\n\r\nThe device is vulnerable only if FTP is enabled on the management interface. FTP is disabled by default.\r\n  Determining Whether FTP Is Configured\r\nAn administrator can determine whether FTP is configured on the management interface by using one of the following three methods.\r\n\r\nFirst Method to Determine Whether FTP Is Configured\r\n\r\nThe administrator can issue the showconfig command and check whether the ftpd port is configured on the management interface.\r\n\r\n\r\nciscowsa> showconfig\r\nChoose the password option:\r\n1. Mask passwords (Files with masked passwords cannot be loaded using loadconfig command)\r\n2. Plain passphrases\r\n[1]> 1\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n<interfaces>\r\n<interface>\r\n<interface_name>Management</interface_name>\r\n<ip>x.x.x.x</ip>\r\n<phys_interface>Management</phys_interface>\r\n<netmask>24</netmask>\r\n<interface_hostname>xxx.xxx.xxx</interface_hostname>\r\n<ftpd_port>21</ftpd_port>\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nSecond Method to Determine Whether FTP Is Configured\r\n\r\nThe administrator can check the  FTP configuration by issuing the ifconfig command. In this example, the management interface is configured for FTP. The Y value in square brackets represents the current configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\nciscowsa> ifconfig\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nChoose the operation you want to perform:\r\n- NEW - Create a new interface.\r\n- EDIT - Modify an interface.\r\n- DELETE - Remove an interface.\r\n- DETAILS - Show details of an interface.\r\n> EDIT\r\n\r\nEnter the number of the interface you wish to edit.\r\n[]> 1\r\n.\r\n.\r\nDo you want to enable FTP on this interface? [Y]>\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nThird Method to Determine Whether FTP Is Configured\r\n  The administrator can also use the GUI to check the FTP configuration by navigating to Network > Interfaces > Appliance Management Services and determining whether the FTP check box is checked.\r\n\r\nDetermining the WSA Software Release\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable release of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco WSA, administrators can use the version command in the WSA CLI. The following example shows the results for an appliance that is running Cisco AsyncOS Software Release 10.5.1-296:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscowsa> version\r\nCurrent Version\r\n===============\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort S670 Web Security Appliance\r\nModel: S670\r\nVersion: 10.5.1-296\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/support/tsd_cisco_worldwide_contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco AsyncOS for WSA Software. The right column indicates whether a major release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first minor release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following table:\r\n                                Cisco AsyncOS for WSA Software Major Release                            First Fixed Release for This Advisory                                                 Prior to 10.5.1\r\n              Not vulnerable\r\n                                  10.5.1\r\n              10.5.2-042  or later\r\n                                  11.0 and later\r\n              Not vulnerable\r\n\r\nIn most cases, a WSA can be updated over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the System Administration GUI. Administrators can use the following steps to upgrade a device by using the System Administration GUI:\r\n\r\n      Choose System Administration > System Upgrade.\r\n      Click Upgrade Options.\r\n      Choose Download and Install.\r\n      Choose the release to upgrade to.\r\n      In the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.\r\n      Click Proceed to begin the upgrade.
