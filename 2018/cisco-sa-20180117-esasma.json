				"text": "A vulnerability in the administrative shell of the Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate their privilege level and gain root access. The attacker has to have a valid user credential with at least a privilege level of a guest user.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an incorrect networking configuration at the administrative shell CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and issuing a set of crafted, malicious commands at the administrative shell. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain root access on the device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180117-esasma [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180117-esasma\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects all software versions through the first fixed release of Cisco AsyncOS Software for ESA and Content SMA, for both virtual and hardware appliances.\r\n\r\nCisco Cloud Email Security (CES) includes the ESA and SMA as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting CES support.\r\n\r\nDetermining the Software Version\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco ESA, administrators can use the version command in the ESA CLI. The following example shows the results for a device running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 9.7.2-065:\r\nciscoesa> version\r\nCurrent Version\r\n===============\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance\r\nModel: X1070\r\nVersion: 9.7.2-065\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS Software is running on a Cisco SMA, administrators can use the version command in the SMA CLI. The following example shows the results for a device running Cisco AsyncOS Software version 9.1.1-005:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscosma> version\r\nCurrent Version\r\n===============\r\nProduct: Cisco IronPort M670 Security Management(tm) Appliance\r\nModel: M670\r\nVersion: 9.1.1-005\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nIn the following tables, the left column lists major releases of Cisco AsyncOS Software for ESA and SMA. The right column indicates whether a major release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first minor release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following tables:\r\n                                Cisco AsyncOS ESA Software Major Release                            First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability                                                Prior to 9.8\r\n               Affected; migrate to 9.8.0-015 or 10.0.1-087                                   9.8               9.8.0-092                                   10.0\r\n               10.0.1-087                                   11.0               Not vulnerable\r\n\r\n                                Cisco AsyncOS SMA Software Major Release                            First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability                                                Prior to 10.1\r\n              Affected; migrate to 11.0.0-115\r\n                                  10.1               Affected; migrate to 11.0.0-115\r\n                                  10.5               Affected; migrate to 11.0.0-115                                   11.0\r\n              11.0.0-115\r\n\r\n  In most cases, administrators can upgrade ESA and SMA software over the network by doing the following in the Cisco AsyncOS System Administration GUI:\r\n\r\nChoose System Administration > System Upgrade.\r\nClick Upgrade Options.\r\nClick Download.\r\nChoose the Cisco AsyncOS Software release to upgrade to.\r\nIn the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.\r\nClick Proceed. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade is complete, the ESA or SMA will reboot.",
