If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nCisco UCS Central Release 2.0(1c) resolves this vulnerability.\r\n  Software is available for download from Cisco Software Central [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/release.html?mdfid=286312995&flowid=82511&softwareid=284308194&release=2.0(1c)&relind=AVAILABLE&rellifecycle=&reltype=latest\"] from the following path: Downloads Home > Products > Servers - Unified Computing > UCS Central Software > UCS Central 2.x.",
