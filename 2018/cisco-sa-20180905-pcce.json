In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive browser-based information.\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0444\r\n\r\nThe Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Packaged Contact Center Enterprise could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a customized link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0445\r\n\r\nThe SIR for this vulnerability is: Medium",
