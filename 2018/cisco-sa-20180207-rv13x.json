				"text": "A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco RV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N VPN and RV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and gain full control of an affected system, including issuing commands with root privileges. The attacker could also cause an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an incomplete input validation on user-controlled input in an HTTP request to the targeted device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user and gain full control of the affected system or cause it to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180207-rv13x [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180207-rv13x\"]",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in firmware version 1.0.1.11 for the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\nRV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N VPN Router\r\nRV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Router\r\n\r\nThe firmware updates can be downloaded from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com by navigating to Products > Routers > Small Business Routers > Small Business RV Series Routers.",
