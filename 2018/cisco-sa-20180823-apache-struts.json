				"text": "A vulnerability in Apache Struts could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates user-supplied input, allowing the use of results with no namespace value and the use of url tags with no value or action. In cases where upper actions or configurations also have no namespace or a wildcard namespace, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request that submits malicious input to the affected application for processing. If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the affected application on the targeted system.\r\nThe following  Snort rules can be used to detect possible exploitation of this  vulnerability: Snort SID 29639, 39190, 39191, and 47634\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180823-apache-struts [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180823-apache-struts\"]",
