				"text": "A vulnerability in Cisco AMP for Endpoints Mac Connector Software installed on Apple macOS 10.12 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a kernel panic on an affected system, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists if the affected software is running in Block network conviction mode. Exploitation could occur if the system that is running the affected software starts a server process and an address in the IP blacklist cache of the affected software attempts to connect to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a kernel panic on the system that is running the affected software, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180801-fampmac [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180801-fampmac\"]",
