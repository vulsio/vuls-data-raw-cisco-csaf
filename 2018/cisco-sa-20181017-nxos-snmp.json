				"text": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause the SNMP application of an affected device to restart unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of SNMP protocol data units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-nxos-snmp [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181017-nxos-snmp\"]",

				"text": "SNMP is an application-layer protocol that provides a standardized framework and a common language for monitoring and managing devices in a network. It defines a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents.\r\n\r\nAn SNMP agent gathers data from the SNMP MIB, which is the repository of information about device parameters and network data. It also responds to requests from an SNMP manager to get or set data. An SNMP agent contains MIB variables for which values can be requested or changed by an SNMP manager by using get or set operations.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP supported on the device���Versions 1, 2c, and 3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific SNMP packet to an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. A community string is a password that is applied to a device to restrict both read-only and read-write access to the SNMP data on the device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be chosen carefully to ensure that they are not trivial. They should also be changed at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, the strings should be changed when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the organization.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system.",

				"text": "There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nAs a mitigation for the vulnerability that is described in this advisory, administrators can configure an access control list (ACL) on an SNMP community. This ACL will filter incoming SNMP requests to ensure that SNMP polling is performed only by trusted SNMP clients. In the following example, the device will accept incoming SNMP requests only from the trusted hosts 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch# show access-list acl_for_snmp\r\nIPV4 ACL acl_for_snmp\r\n  10 permit udp 192.168.1.2/32 192.168.1.3/32 eq snmp\r\n\r\nTo implement the preceding ACL, administrators can add it to the snmp-server community configuration command:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch# show running-config snmp\r\nsnmp-server community mycompany   use-acl acl_for_snmp\r\n\r\nFor additional information about configuring ACLs to filter incoming SNMP requests, see Filtering SNMP Requests [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5000/sw/system_management/b_Cisco_Nexus_5000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide/Cisco_Nexus_5000_Series_NX-OS_System_Management_Configuration_Guide_chapter9.html#task_D3862190751F4B1A9F5353B015A888A7\"] in the Cisco NX-OS configuration guide.",
