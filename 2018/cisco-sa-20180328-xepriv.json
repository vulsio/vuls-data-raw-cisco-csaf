				"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based user interface (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain elevated privileges on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software does not reset the privilege level for each web UI session. An attacker who has valid credentials for an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by remotely accessing a VTY line to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access an affected device with the privileges of the user who previously logged in to the web UI.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-xepriv [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180328-xepriv\"]\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 28, 2018, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 20 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 22 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2018 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-66682\"].",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software, if the HTTP Server feature is enabled and authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) authorization is not configured for EXEC sessions. The default state of the HTTP Server feature is version-dependent.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability was introduced in Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.1.1. For more information about which Cisco IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fixed\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Assessing the HTTP Server Configuration\r\nTo determine whether the HTTP Server feature is enabled for a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show running-config | include http (secure|server) command in the CLI to check for the presence of the ip http server command or the ip http secure-server command in the global configuration. If either command is present and configured, the HTTP Server feature is enabled for the device.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show running-config | include http (secure|server) command for a router that has the HTTP Server feature enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config | include http (secure|server)\r\n  ip http server  ip http secure-server\r\n    Assessing the AAA Configuration\r\nTo determine whether AAA authorization for EXEC sessions is configured for a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show running-config | include aaa authorization exec command in the CLI to check for the presence of the aaa authorization exec [options] command in the global configuration.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show running-config | include aaa authorization exec command for a router that is configured to have its AAA authorization enforced by a TACACS+ server and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config | include aaa authorization exec\r\n  aaa authorization exec use-tacacs group tacacs+\r\n    Determining the Cisco IOS XE Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or similar text.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nios-xe-device# show version\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n                        Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S���in the following field:",
