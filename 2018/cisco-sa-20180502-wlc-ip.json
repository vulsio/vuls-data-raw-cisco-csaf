				"text": "A vulnerability in the IP Version 4 (IPv4) fragment reassembly function of Cisco 3500, 5500, and 8500 Series Wireless LAN Controller Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a corruption of an internal data structure process that occurs when the affected software reassembles certain IPv4 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain malformed IPv4 fragments to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180502-wlc-ip [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180502-wlc-ip\"]",

The following example shows the command output for a device that is running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.3.102.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n(wlc)> show sysinfo\r\n\r\nManufacturer's Name.............................. Cisco Systems Inc.\r\nProduct Name..................................... Cisco Controller\r\nProduct Version.................................. 8.3.102.0\r\nBootloader Version............................... 1.0.1\r\nField Recovery Image Version..................... 6.0.182.0\r\nFirmware Version................................. FPGA 1.3, Env 1.6, USB console 1.27\r\nBuild Type....................................... DATA + WPS\r\n.  .  .\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco Mobility Express Software Release\r\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco Mobility Express Software release is running on a device, administrators can use the web interface or the CLI of the device.\r\n\r\nTo use the web interface, do the following:\r\n\r\nBy using a browser, log in to the web interface.\r\nChoose System Software > Software Upgrade.\r\nRefer to the value in the System Software Version field.\r\n\r\nTo use the CLI, log in to the access point via a Telnet or SSH session, issue the show version command, and then refer to the command output. The following example shows the command output for a Cisco Aironet 1852i Access Point that is running Cisco Mobility Express Software Release 8.3.111.0:\r\n\r\n\r\nAP# show version\r\n  cisco AIR-AP1852I-UXK9 ARMv7 Processor rev 0 (v71) with 997184/525160K bytes of memory.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nCustomers should upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the table in this section.
