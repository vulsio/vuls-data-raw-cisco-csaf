An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by providing a user with a malicious .arf or .wrf file via email or URL and convincing the user to launch the file in the Webex recording players. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could cause an affected player to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Webex players are applications that are used to play back Webex meetings that have been recorded by an online meeting attendee. The Webex Network Recording Player for .arf files can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording that is hosted on a Webex server. The Webex Player for .wrf files can be downloaded manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180718-webex-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180718-webex-dos\"]",

Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers can host in their private clouds.\r\n\r\nCisco Webex Meetings services can be configured to allow recording of a meeting that is stored online and can be downloaded by a user in ARF format. These services can also record meetings directly on local computers in WRF format. The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player plays .arf files and the Cisco Webex Player plays .wrf files.\r\n\r\nThe Network Recording Player can be automatically installed when a user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a Cisco Webex Meetings Suite site (for streaming playback mode). The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player can also be installed manually. The Cisco Webex Player can only be manually installed from the Webex site.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for .arf files is available for Cisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS31, WBS32, WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online, and for Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The Cisco Webex Player for .wrf files is only available for Cisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33) and Cisco Webex Meetings Online. The Cisco Webex Player for .wrf files is not available for Cisco Webex Meetings Server.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and the Cisco Webex Player.
