Cisco Webex Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers can host in their private clouds.\r\n\r\nCisco Webex Meetings services can be configured to allow recording of a meeting that is stored online and can be downloaded by a user in ARF format. These services can also record meetings directly on local computers in WRF format. The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player plays .arf files and the Cisco Webex Player plays .wrf files.\r\n\r\nThe Network Recording Player can be automatically installed when a user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a Cisco Webex Meetings Suite site (for streaming playback mode). The Cisco Webex Network Recording Player can also be installed manually. The Cisco Webex Player can only be manually installed from the Webex site.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Webex Network Recording Player for .arf files is available for Cisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS31, WBS32, WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online, and for Cisco Webex Meetings Server. The Cisco Webex Player for .wrf files is only available for Cisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS31, WBS32, and WBS33) and Cisco Webex Meetings Online. The Cisco Webex Player for .wrf files is not available for Cisco Webex Meetings Server.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player.

However, it is possible to remove the affected Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player by following the uninstall procedure for the operating system. For example, in Windows, use Add or Remove Programs to uninstall the affected players.\r\n\r\nTo remove Webex software completely from a system, use the Meeting Services Removal Tool (for Microsoft Windows users) or Mac Webex Meeting Application Uninstaller (for Apple Mac OS X users), available for download from the Cisco Collaboration Help article Cisco WebEx and 3rd Party Support Utilities [\"https://collaborationhelp.cisco.com/article/en-us/WBX000026396\"].\r\n\r\nRemoval of the Webex software from a Linux or UNIX-based system can be accomplished by following the steps in the Cisco Collaboration Help article How Do I Uninstall WebEx Software on a Linux or Unix Based System?

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerabilities described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nThe following versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player available from the Cisco Webex Meetings Suite sites (WBS32, WBS33), Cisco Webex Meetings Online site, and Cisco Webex Meetings Server address all the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS32) - Cisco Webex Network Recording Player versions WBS32.15.10 and later\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Suite (WBS33) - Cisco Webex Network Recording Player versions WBS33.3 and later\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Online - Webex Network Recording Player versions 1.3.37 and later\r\nCisco Webex Meetings Server - Webex Network Recording Player versions 3.0MR2 and later\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the latest versions of the ARF player are available from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"].\r\nThe Cisco Webex Network Recording Player (for .arf files) will be automatically upgraded to the latest, non-vulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a Cisco Webex Meetings site that contains the versions previously specified. Users will need to manually uninstall the Cisco Webex Player and get the updated version of the Cisco Webex Player from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"] or from a Cisco Webex Meetings site specified previously.\r\n\r\nNote: Customers on lockdown sites will not automatically get updated versions of the Cisco Webex Network Recording Player.
