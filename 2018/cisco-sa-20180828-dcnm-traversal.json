An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests containing directory traversal character sequences within the management interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to view or create arbitrary files on the targeted system.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\nThis vulnerability was first resolved in Cisco DCNM Software Release 11.0(1).\r\n\r\nThe software is available for download from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home\"] on Cisco.com by navigating to Products > Cloud and Systems Management > Data Center Infrastructure Management > Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager or via direct link [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home/281722751/type/282088134/\"].\r\n\r\nThe DCNM Special Release patch [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/special/release.html?config=b6650bf3dace29f091ee9f42bb29f603\"] for affected versions of Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager is available to correct this vulnerability.\r\nFor RHEL (Linux DCNM install), this patch is applicable only if DCNM is installed at the default install location (/usr/local/cisco/dcm).\r\n\r\n       1. Download and extract the patch file in 10.x DCNM server in any directory.\r\n       2. Run the dcnmweb_patch.sh script under the patch directory.",
