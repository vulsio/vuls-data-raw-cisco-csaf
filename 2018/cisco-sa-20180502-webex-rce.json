				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco WebEx Network Recording Player for Advanced Recording Format (ARF) files could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a design flaw in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user an email attachment or link to a malicious ARF file and persuading the user to open the file or follow the link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user���s system.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180502-webex-rce [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180502-webex-rce\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, and Cisco WebEx ARF players. For information about affected software releases, consult the Cisco bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco WebEx Meetings site is running an affected version of a WebEx client build, users can log in to the Cisco WebEx Meetings site and go to Support > Downloads. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under About Meeting Center.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, version information for a Cisco WebEx Meetings client can be accessed directly within the Cisco WebEx Meetings client. Version information for the Cisco WebEx Meetings client on Windows and Linux platforms can be viewed by choosing Help > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center. Version information for the Cisco WebEx Meetings client on Mac platforms can be viewed by choosing Meeting Center > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center.\r\n\r\nCisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 30.32.16 is fixed, build 30.32.17 will contain updated software. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, for example, T30 SP32 EP 16, which shows that the server is running client build 30.32.16.\r\n\r\nNote: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.",

				"text": "Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS) meeting services are a hosted multimedia conferencing solution that is managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The Cisco WebEx Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers can host in their private clouds.\r\n\r\nThe ARF file format is used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx ARF Player is an application that is used to play back and edit WebEx ARF recording files (files with an .arf filename extension).\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx ARF Player can be installed automatically when a user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a Cisco WebEx Meetings site (for stream playback mode). The Cisco WebEx ARF Player can also be installed manually after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html [\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"] for offline playback of recording files.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx ARF Player is available for all Cisco WebEx Business Suite clients (WBS31 and WBS32), Cisco WebEx Meetings clients, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server clients.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability described in this advisory could allow an attacker to cause a player application to crash or, in some cases, remotely execute arbitrary code on an affected system.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to persuade a user to open a malicious ARF file by using the player application on an affected system. The attacker may be able to accomplish an exploit by providing the malicious ARF file directly to users, as an email attachment for example, or by directing a user to a malicious web page. This vulnerability cannot be triggered by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.",
