				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services component of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software insufficiently validates header values in Cisco Fabric Services packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow that could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-fxnxos-fab-ace [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-fxnxos-fab-ace\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities.

				"text": "Cisco Fabric Services provides a common infrastructure for distributing and synchronizing configuration data between Cisco devices that are on the same network and with virtual port channels (vPCs). This includes configuration data for applications and features that are compatible with and enabled to use Cisco Fabric Services���for example, Distributed Device Alias Services, Network Time Protocol (NTP), and user and administrator roles.\r\n\r\nTo distribute and synchronize data, Cisco Fabric Services can be configured to use any of the following distribution types:\r\n\r\nCisco Fabric Services over Fibre Channel (CFSoFC)���Distributes data over a Fibre Channel (FC), such as a virtual storage area network (VSAN). CFSoFC distribution is enabled by default.\r\nCisco Fabric Services over Ethernet (CFSoE)���Distributes data over an Ethernet network. For vPC support, Cisco Fabric Services must be configured to use this distribution type. CFSoE distribution is disabled by default.\r\nCisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP)���Distributes data over an IPv4 or IPv6 network. CFSoIP distribution is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability described in this advisory is due to insufficient input validation that could occur when the affected software processes Cisco Fabric Services packets that it receives during distribution and synchronization operations. Exploitation of the vulnerability does not require any applications to be enabled to use Cisco Fabric Services. Instead, exploitation depends on which Cisco Fabric Services distribution types are configured for a device. In addition, the attack vectors vary based on which distribution types are configured, as follows:\r\n\r\nCFSoFC���An attack could occur via Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) or Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP), if FC ports are configured for a device. In this scenario, an attack could succeed in the data plane, not the management plane, of any FC port. If no FC ports are configured for a device, this distribution type cannot be used to exploit the vulnerability.\r\nCFSoE���An attack is possible from only a vPC peer or an attacker who has access to a vPC peer link. No other peer, neighbor, or network node can be used to exploit the vulnerability.\r\nCFSoIP���An attack is possible from any node that has IP network connectivity to the management interface of a device. In this scenario, an attack cannot succeed from the data plane.\r\n\r\nIf a device is enabled to use more than one distribution type, the applicable attack vectors for all those distribution types exist for the device.\r\n\r\nAdministrators can display configuration information and check the distribution status of Cisco Fabric Services for a device by using the show cfs status command in the device CLI, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch# show cfs status\r\nDistribution : Enabled  Distribution over IP : Disabled  IPv4 multicast address : 239.255.70.83  IPv6 multicast address : ff15::efff:4653  Distribution over Ethernet : Disabled\r\n\r\nIn the preceding example, the Enabled value in the Distribution field of the command output indicates that Cisco Fabric Services is enabled for the device and the device is configured to use the default Cisco Fabric Services distribution type, which is CFSoFC. The Disabled value in the Distribution over IP field and the Distribution over Ethernet field indicates that the device is not additionally configured to use the CFSoIP and CFSoE distribution types.",

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section.
