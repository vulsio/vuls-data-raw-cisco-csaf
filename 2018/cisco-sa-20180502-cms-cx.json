				"text": "A vulnerability in Cisco Meeting Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to components of, or sensitive information in, an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect default configuration of the device, which can expose internal interfaces and ports on the external interface of the system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated access to configuration and database files as well as sensitive meeting information on an affected system.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if the Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) service is enabled and utilizing Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections, an attacker could utilize TURN credentials to forward traffic to device daemons, allowing for remote exploitation.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180502-cms-cx [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180502-cms-cx\"]",

The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running CMS Software Release 2.2.11:\r\nsystem> version\r\n2_2_11\r\n  For TLS to be configured to run with a TURN server, the turn tls and turn certs commands must be present in the configuration. To check the Mainboard Management Processor (MMP) TLS configuration for the TURN server, administrators can issue the turn command in the MMP console.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the turn command for a system that has TLS configured for the TURN server:\r\ncms > turn\r\nEnabled: true  Username: cisco  Password: 1234  Realm: nicedet.com  Public IP: none  Relay address: 1.2.3.4  TLS port: 3479  TLS cert: turn.crt  TLS key: turn.key  TLS bundle: none  Listen interface a",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is fixed in CMS Software Releases 2.2.11 and later. Customers should upgrade to the latest software release by visiting the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com and navigating to Products & Services > Collaboration > Cisco Meeting Server > Download Software > Acano X-series.\r\n\r\nFor information about the CMS software release model, refer to Cisco Meeting Server: End of maintenance and support policy [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/conferencing/ciscoMeetingServer/White_papers/Cisco-Meeting-Server-End-of-Maintenance-and-support-of-sofware.pdf\"].",
