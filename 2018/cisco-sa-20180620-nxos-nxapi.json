				"text": "A vulnerability in the NX-API management application programming interface (API) in devices running, or based on, Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands with elevated privileges.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate certain parameters included within an NX-API request. An attacker that can successfully authenticate to the NX-API could submit a request designed to bypass NX-OS role assignment. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with elevated privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nxos-nxapi [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-nxos-nxapi\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities.

				"text": "This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software and are configured to use the NX-API feature:\r\n\r\nMDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches\r\nNexus 2000 Series Switches\r\nNexus 3000 Series Switches\r\nNexus 3500 Platform Switches\r\nNexus 5500 Platform Switches\r\nNexus 5600 Platform Switches\r\nNexus 6000 Series Switches\r\nNexus 7000 Series Switches\r\nNexus 7700 Series Switches\r\nNexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco NX-OS Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Assessing the Cisco NX-API configuration\r\nTo determine whether a device has enabled the NX-API feature, administrators can log in to the device and check the configuration for the presence of the feature nxapi command. If the device is configured to use the NX-API feature, the output of the show running-config all | inc nxapi command will be similar to the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nCLI(config)# show running all | inc nxapi\r\n feature nxapi     nxapi http port 443     no nxapi http     no nxapi sandbox  .  .  .\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release\r\nAdministrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the show version command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of this command on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.3(2)D1(1):\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos-switch# show version\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software\r\nTAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac  Documents: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9372/tsd_products_support_series_home.html  Copyright (c) 2002-2017, Cisco Systems, Inc.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\n\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection.
