				"text": "A vulnerability in the ingress packet processing functionality of the Cisco Virtualized Packet Core-Distributed Instance (VPC-DI) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause both control function (CF) instances on an affected system to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of user-supplied data by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious traffic to the internal distributed instance (DI) network address on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unhandled error condition on the affected system, which would cause the CF instances to reload and consequently cause the entire VPC to reload, resulting in the disconnection of all subscribers and a DoS condition on the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180207-vpcdi [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180207-vpcdi\"]",

The following example shows the output of the command for a VPC-DI instance that is running Cisco StarOS Release 19.3.v5 (VPC-DI Release N4.2.5). Please refer to the table in the Fixed Software section, which lists all major releases of both VPC-DI and Cisco StarOS software respectively.\r\n\r\n[local]VPC-001# show version\r\n\r\nActive Software:\r\nImage Version:                  19.3.v5\r\nImage Build Number:             65002\r\nImage Description:              Deployment_Build\r\nImage Date:                     Wed Sep 14 05:35:14 EDT 2016\r\nBoot Image:                     /flash/qvpc-di-19.3.v5.bin",

The DI network should be a unique, isolated network reserved for the exclusive use of a single VPC-DI instance. No other devices should be connected to the DI network. If more than one VPC-DI instance is instantiated in the same data center, each instance should have its own DI network.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to the DI network interface of a VPC-DI instance via IPv4.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerable code exists only in VPC-DI Software.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists major releases of Cisco VPC-DI Software and the middle column lists major releases of Cisco StarOS.
