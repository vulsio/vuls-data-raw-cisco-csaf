				"text": "Four vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct XSS attacks against a user of the interface, conduct a CSRF attack, or retrieve a cleartext password.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCisco Unified Contact Center Express Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored XSS attack against a user of the web-based interface of an affected application.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of an affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\r\n\r\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0400\r\n\r\nThe Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Base score for this vulnerability is: 6.1 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\"]\r\n\r\nThe Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCvg70904 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg70904\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Unified Contact Center Express Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected XSS attack against a user of the web-based interface of an affected application.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based interface of an affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0401\r\n\r\nThe CVSS Base score for this vulnerability is: 6.1 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\"]\r\n\r\nThe Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCvg70967 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg70967\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Unified Contact Center Express Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a CSRF attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected application.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download, create, modify, and delete metadata files that are part of the Repository Datastore (RDS) on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.\r\n\r\nFor additional information about cross-site request forgery attacks and potential mitigation methods, see the action link in the right sidebar of this advisory.\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0402\r\n\r\nThe CVSS Base score for this vulnerability is: 6.3 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L\"]\r\n\r\nThe Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCvg70921 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg70921\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Unified Contact Center Express Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to retrieve a cleartext password.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability occurs because the application prefills the password field with a previously saved password from an internal database. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by viewing the HTML source of an affected login form.\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-0403\r\n\r\nThe CVSS Base score for this vulnerability is: 5.3 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\"]\r\n\r\nThe Cisco bug ID for this vulnerability is: CSCvg71040 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg71040\"]",
