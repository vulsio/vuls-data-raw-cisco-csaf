				"text": "Cisco Umbrella uses the internet infrastructure to block connections to malicious destinations before any connections to those destinations can be established. Cisco Umbrella also provides visibility into internet activity across all devices and all ports, even when users are no longer connected to the corporate network. Cisco Umbrella is configured and managed by using a browser-based interface, the Cisco Umbrella Dashboard.\r\n\r\nOn March 14, 2018, the Cisco Umbrella Dashboard was updated to enforce new default session timeout values that impact idle and absolute timeouts for all Cisco Umbrella Dashboard sessions. The session timeout values were changed in response to a report by an external researcher who was concerned about session-timer exploitation. Additionally, these changes better align with OWASP recommendations. The new values impact idle and absolute timeouts for all Cisco Umbrella Dashboard sessions.\r\n  Additional Information\r\nThe new timeout values for all Cisco Umbrella Dashboard sessions have been set to the following:\r\n\r\nIdle timeout: 20 minutes\r\nAbsolute timeout: 16 hours\r\n\r\nAdditional information is available on the Cisco Umbrella Announcements page at https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000384363 [\"https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000384363\"].\r\n  Cisco Security Procedures\r\nComplete information about reporting security vulnerabilities in Cisco products, obtaining assistance with security incidents, and registering to receive security information from Cisco, is available from the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/security-vulnerability-policy.html\"].
