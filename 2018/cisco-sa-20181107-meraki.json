An exploit could allow the attacker to establish an interactive session to the device with elevated privileges. The attacker could then use the elevated privileges to further compromise the device or obtain additional configuration data from the device that is being exploited.\r\n\r\n\r\n Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-meraki [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-meraki\"]",
