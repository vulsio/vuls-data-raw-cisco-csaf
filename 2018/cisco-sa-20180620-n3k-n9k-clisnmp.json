				"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of a specific CLI command and the associated Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) MIB for Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system memory on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of the CLI command, resulting in a failure to free all allocated memory upon completion. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and repeatedly issuing a specific CLI command or sending a specific SNMP poll request for a specific Object Identifier (OID). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IP routing process to restart or to cause a device reset, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-n3k-n9k-clisnmp [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180620-n3k-n9k-clisnmp\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the June 2018 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Collection, which includes 24 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 24 vulnerabilities.

				"text": "The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application-layer protocol that provides a standardized framework and a common language for monitoring and managing devices in a network. It defines a message format for communication between SNMP managers and agents.\r\n\r\nAn SNMP agent gathers data from the SNMP MIB, which is the repository of information about device parameters and network data. It also responds to requests from an SNMP manager to get or set data. An SNMP agent contains MIB variables for which values can be requested or changed by an SNMP manager by using get or set operations.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP supported on the device���Versions 1, 2c, and 3. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific SNMP packet to an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6. Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 2c or earlier, the attacker must know the SNMP read-only community string for the affected system. A community string is a password that is applied to a device to restrict both read-only and read-write access to the SNMP data on the device. These community strings, as with all passwords, should be chosen carefully to ensure that they are not trivial. They should also be changed at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, the strings should be changed when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the organization.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability via SNMP Version 3, the attacker must have user credentials for the affected system.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must take time to repeatedly send a specific CLI command or send a specific SNMP poll request for a specific OID to the affected device. Therefore, the attacker cannot immediately exhaust system memory; instead, system resources would be consumed over time.",
