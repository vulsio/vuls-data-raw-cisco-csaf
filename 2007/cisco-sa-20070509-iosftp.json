Customers can then  compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of the  vulnerability in individual networks.\r\n\r\nCisco PSIRT will set the bias in all cases to normal. Customers are  encouraged to apply the bias parameter when determining the environmental  impact of a particular vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCVSS is a standards based scoring method that conveys vulnerability  severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.\r\n\r\nCisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding CVSS  at    http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html\"].\r\n\r\nCisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the  environmental impact for individual networks at    http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x\"].\r\n\r\nCSCek55259 - Improper authorization checking in IOS FTP\r\n\r\n Calculate the environmental score of  CSCek55259 [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?target=new&vector=AV:R/AC:L/Au:NR/C:C/I:C/A:C/B:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C\"]\r\n\r\nCVSS Base Score - 10\r\n\r\nAccess Vector\r\n\r\nAccess Complexity\r\n\r\nAuthentication\r\n\r\nConfidentiality Impact\r\n\r\nIntegrity Impact\r\n\r\nAvailability Impact\r\n\r\nImpact Bias\r\n\r\nRemote\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\nNot Required\r\n\r\nComplete\r\n\r\nComplete\r\n\r\nComplete\r\n\r\nNormal\r\n\r\nCVSS Temporal Score - 8.3\r\n\r\nExploitability\r\n\r\nRemediation Level\r\n\r\nReport Confidence\r\n\r\nFunctional\r\n\r\nOfficial-Fix\r\n\r\nConfirmed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCSCse29244 - IOS reload when transferring files via FTP\r\n\r\n Calculate the environmental score of  CSCse29244 [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?target=new&vector=AV:R/AC:L/Au:R/C:N/I:N/A:C/B:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C\"]\r\n\r\nCVSS Base Score - 2.0\r\n\r\nAccess Vector\r\n\r\nAccess Complexity\r\n\r\nAuthentication\r\n\r\nConfidentiality Impact\r\n\r\nIntegrity Impact\r\n\r\nAvailability Impact\r\n\r\nImpact Bias\r\n\r\nRemote\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\nRequired\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\nComplete\r\n\r\nNormal\r\n\r\nCVSS Temporal Score - 1.7\r\n\r\nExploitability\r\n\r\nRemediation Level\r\n\r\nReport Confidence\r\n\r\nFunctional\r\n\r\nOfficial-Fix\r\n\r\nConfirmed",

				"text": "Customers can disable the use of the IOS FTP Server feature by  executing the following command in configuration mode:\r\n\r\n\r\n\nno ftp-server enable\r\n\r\nAdditional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the  network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion  document for this advisory:\r\n\r\n http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20070509-iosftp [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20070509-iosftp\"]\r\n     Alternative File Transfer Mechanisms\r\nCisco IOS supports multiple methods for transferring files to and from  the device. One such method is Secure Copy (SCP). SCP is supported on Cisco IOS  images that support strong cryptography. More information on the SCP feature  can be found at the following url:\r\n\r\n http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t2/feature/guide/ftscp.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t2/feature/guide/ftscp.html\"]\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)  server in IOS. Information on configuring the TFTP server can be found  here:\r\n\r\n http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/configfun/configuration/guide/fcf011_ps1835_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/configfun/configuration/guide/fcf011_ps1835_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html\"]\r\n\r\nIf disabling the IOS FTP Server is not feasible, customers can limit  FTP access to the device via one of the following mechanisms:\r\n   Infrastructure ACLs (iACL)\r\nAlthough it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your  network, it is possible to identify traffic which should never be allowed to  target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of your  network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a network security best practice  and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as  well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The ACL example shown  below should be included as part of the deployed infrastructure access-list  which will protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP  address range.\r\n\r\nA sample access list for devices running Cisco IOS is below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n !--- Permit FTP services from trusted hosts destined  !--- to infrastructure addresses.   access-list 150 permit tcp TRUSTED_HOSTS MASK INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 21 access-list 150 permit tcp TRUSTED_HOSTS MASK INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 20   !--- Deny FTP packets from all other sources destined to infrastructure addresses.   access-list 150 deny   tcp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 21 access-list 150 deny   tcp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 20   !--- Permit all other traffic to transit the device.   access-list 150 permit IP any any  interface serial 2/0   ip access-group 150 in\r\n\r\nThe white paper entitled \"Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure  Protection Access Control Lists\" presents guidelines and recommended deployment  techniques for infrastructure protection access lists. This white paper can be  obtained here:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"].\r\n     Receive ACLs (rACL)\r\nFor distributed platforms, Receive ACLs may be an option starting in  Cisco IOS Software Versions 12.0(21)S2 for the 12000 (GSR), 12.0(24)S for the  7500, and 12.0(31)S for the 10720. The Receive ACL protects the device from  harmful traffic before the traffic can impact the route processor. Receive ACLs  are designed to only protect the device on which it is configured. On the  12000, 7500, and 10720, transit traffic is never affected by a receive ACL.  Because of this, the destination IP address \"any\" used in the example ACL  entries below only refer to the router's own physical or virtual IP addresses.  Receive ACLs are considered a network security best practice, and should be  considered as a long-term addition to good network security, as well as a  workaround for this specific vulnerability. The white paper entitled \"GSR:  Receive Access Control Lists\" will help you identify and allow legitimate  traffic to your device and deny all unwanted packets:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml\"].\r\n\r\nThe following is the receive path ACL written to permit this type of  traffic from trusted hosts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n !--- Permit FTP from trusted hosts allowed to the RP.   access-list 151 permit tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 21 access-list 151 permit tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 20   !--- Deny FTP from all other sources to the RP.   access-list 151 deny   tcp any any eq 21 access-list 151 deny   tcp any any eq 20   !--- Permit all other traffic to the RP. !--- according to security policy and configurations.   access-list 151 permit ip any any   !--- Apply this access list to the 'receive' path.   ip receive access-list 151\r\n    Control Plane Policing (CoPP)\r\nThe Control Plane Policing (CoPP) feature may be used to mitigate these  vulnerabilities. In the following example, only FTP traffic from trusted hosts  and with 'receive' destination IP addresses is permitted to reach the route  processor (RP).\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that dropping traffic from unknown or untrusted IP  addresses may affect hosts with dynamically assigned IP addresses from  connecting to the Cisco IOS device.\r\n\r\n\r\n    access-list 152 deny   tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 21\n    access-list 152 deny   tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 20     access-list 152 permit tcp any any eq 20     access-list 152 permit tcp any any eq 21     access-list 152 deny    ip any any     !     class-map match-all COPP-KNOWN-UNDESIRABLE      match access-group 152     !     !     policy-map COPP-INPUT-POLICY      class COPP-KNOWN-UNDESIRABLE       drop     !     control-plane      service-policy input COPP-INPUT-POLICY\r\n\r\nIn the above CoPP example, the ACL entries that match the exploit  packets with the \"permit\" action result in these packets being discarded by the  policy-map \"drop\" function, while packets that match the \"deny\" action are not  affected by the policy-map drop function.\r\n\r\nCoPP is available in Cisco IOS release trains 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S,  12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T.\r\n\r\nAdditional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature  can be found at the following URL:\r\n\r\n  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html\"]",

One such method is Secure Copy (SCP). SCP is supported on Cisco IOS  images that support strong cryptography. More information on the SCP feature  can be found at the following url:\r\n\r\n http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t2/feature/guide/ftscp.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t2/feature/guide/ftscp.html\"]\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)  server in IOS. Information on configuring the TFTP server can be found  here:\r\n\r\n http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/configfun/configuration/guide/fcf011_ps1835_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/configfun/configuration/guide/fcf011_ps1835_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html\"]\r\n\r\nIf disabling the IOS FTP Server is not feasible, customers can limit  FTP access to the device via one of the following mechanisms:\r\n   Infrastructure ACLs (iACL)\r\nAlthough it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your  network, it is possible to identify traffic which should never be allowed to  target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of your  network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a network security best practice  and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as  well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The ACL example shown  below should be included as part of the deployed infrastructure access-list  which will protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP  address range.\r\n\r\nA sample access list for devices running Cisco IOS is below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n !--- Permit FTP services from trusted hosts destined  !--- to infrastructure addresses.   access-list 150 permit tcp TRUSTED_HOSTS MASK INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 21 access-list 150 permit tcp TRUSTED_HOSTS MASK INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 20   !--- Deny FTP packets from all other sources destined to infrastructure addresses.   access-list 150 deny   tcp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 21 access-list 150 deny   tcp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 20   !--- Permit all other traffic to transit the device.   access-list 150 permit IP any any  interface serial 2/0   ip access-group 150 in\r\n\r\nThe white paper entitled \"Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure  Protection Access Control Lists\" presents guidelines and recommended deployment  techniques for infrastructure protection access lists. This white paper can be  obtained here:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"].\r\n     Receive ACLs (rACL)\r\nFor distributed platforms, Receive ACLs may be an option starting in  Cisco IOS Software Versions 12.0(21)S2 for the 12000 (GSR), 12.0(24)S for the  7500, and 12.0(31)S for the 10720. The Receive ACL protects the device from  harmful traffic before the traffic can impact the route processor. Receive ACLs  are designed to only protect the device on which it is configured. On the  12000, 7500, and 10720, transit traffic is never affected by a receive ACL.  Because of this, the destination IP address \"any\" used in the example ACL  entries below only refer to the router's own physical or virtual IP addresses.  Receive ACLs are considered a network security best practice, and should be  considered as a long-term addition to good network security, as well as a  workaround for this specific vulnerability. The white paper entitled \"GSR:  Receive Access Control Lists\" will help you identify and allow legitimate  traffic to your device and deny all unwanted packets:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml\"].\r\n\r\nThe following is the receive path ACL written to permit this type of  traffic from trusted hosts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n !--- Permit FTP from trusted hosts allowed to the RP.   access-list 151 permit tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 21 access-list 151 permit tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 20   !--- Deny FTP from all other sources to the RP.   access-list 151 deny   tcp any any eq 21 access-list 151 deny   tcp any any eq 20   !--- Permit all other traffic to the RP. !--- according to security policy and configurations.   access-list 151 permit ip any any   !--- Apply this access list to the 'receive' path.   ip receive access-list 151\r\n    Control Plane Policing (CoPP)\r\nThe Control Plane Policing (CoPP) feature may be used to mitigate these  vulnerabilities. In the following example, only FTP traffic from trusted hosts  and with 'receive' destination IP addresses is permitted to reach the route  processor (RP).\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that dropping traffic from unknown or untrusted IP  addresses may affect hosts with dynamically assigned IP addresses from  connecting to the Cisco IOS device.\r\n\r\n\r\n    access-list 152 deny   tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 21\n    access-list 152 deny   tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 20     access-list 152 permit tcp any any eq 20     access-list 152 permit tcp any any eq 21     access-list 152 deny    ip any any     !     class-map match-all COPP-KNOWN-UNDESIRABLE      match access-group 152     !     !     policy-map COPP-INPUT-POLICY      class COPP-KNOWN-UNDESIRABLE       drop     !     control-plane      service-policy input COPP-INPUT-POLICY\r\n\r\nIn the above CoPP example, the ACL entries that match the exploit  packets with the \"permit\" action result in these packets being discarded by the  policy-map \"drop\" function, while packets that match the \"deny\" action are not  affected by the policy-map drop function.\r\n\r\nCoPP is available in Cisco IOS release trains 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S,  12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T.\r\n\r\nAdditional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature  can be found at the following URL:\r\n\r\n  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html\"]"

One such method is Secure Copy (SCP). SCP is supported on Cisco IOS  images that support strong cryptography. More information on the SCP feature  can be found at the following url:\r\n\r\n http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t2/feature/guide/ftscp.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2t/12_2t2/feature/guide/ftscp.html\"]\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is using the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)  server in IOS. Information on configuring the TFTP server can be found  here:\r\n\r\n http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/configfun/configuration/guide/fcf011_ps1835_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_2/configfun/configuration/guide/fcf011_ps1835_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html\"]\r\n\r\nIf disabling the IOS FTP Server is not feasible, customers can limit  FTP access to the device via one of the following mechanisms:\r\n   Infrastructure ACLs (iACL)\r\nAlthough it is often difficult to block traffic transiting your  network, it is possible to identify traffic which should never be allowed to  target your infrastructure devices and block that traffic at the border of your  network. Infrastructure ACLs are considered a network security best practice  and should be considered as a long-term addition to good network security as  well as a workaround for this specific vulnerability. The ACL example shown  below should be included as part of the deployed infrastructure access-list  which will protect all devices with IP addresses in the infrastructure IP  address range.\r\n\r\nA sample access list for devices running Cisco IOS is below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n !--- Permit FTP services from trusted hosts destined  !--- to infrastructure addresses.   access-list 150 permit tcp TRUSTED_HOSTS MASK INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 21 access-list 150 permit tcp TRUSTED_HOSTS MASK INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 20   !--- Deny FTP packets from all other sources destined to infrastructure addresses.   access-list 150 deny   tcp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 21 access-list 150 deny   tcp any INFRASTRUCTURE_ADDRESSES MASK eq 20   !--- Permit all other traffic to transit the device.   access-list 150 permit IP any any  interface serial 2/0   ip access-group 150 in\r\n\r\nThe white paper entitled \"Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure  Protection Access Control Lists\" presents guidelines and recommended deployment  techniques for infrastructure protection access lists. This white paper can be  obtained here:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"].\r\n     Receive ACLs (rACL)\r\nFor distributed platforms, Receive ACLs may be an option starting in  Cisco IOS Software Versions 12.0(21)S2 for the 12000 (GSR), 12.0(24)S for the  7500, and 12.0(31)S for the 10720. The Receive ACL protects the device from  harmful traffic before the traffic can impact the route processor. Receive ACLs  are designed to only protect the device on which it is configured. On the  12000, 7500, and 10720, transit traffic is never affected by a receive ACL.  Because of this, the destination IP address \"any\" used in the example ACL  entries below only refer to the router's own physical or virtual IP addresses.  Receive ACLs are considered a network security best practice, and should be  considered as a long-term addition to good network security, as well as a  workaround for this specific vulnerability. The white paper entitled \"GSR:  Receive Access Control Lists\" will help you identify and allow legitimate  traffic to your device and deny all unwanted packets:  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a0a5e.shtml\"].\r\n\r\nThe following is the receive path ACL written to permit this type of  traffic from trusted hosts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\n !--- Permit FTP from trusted hosts allowed to the RP.   access-list 151 permit tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 21 access-list 151 permit tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 20   !--- Deny FTP from all other sources to the RP.   access-list 151 deny   tcp any any eq 21 access-list 151 deny   tcp any any eq 20   !--- Permit all other traffic to the RP. !--- according to security policy and configurations.   access-list 151 permit ip any any   !--- Apply this access list to the 'receive' path.   ip receive access-list 151\r\n    Control Plane Policing (CoPP)\r\nThe Control Plane Policing (CoPP) feature may be used to mitigate these  vulnerabilities. In the following example, only FTP traffic from trusted hosts  and with 'receive' destination IP addresses is permitted to reach the route  processor (RP).\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that dropping traffic from unknown or untrusted IP  addresses may affect hosts with dynamically assigned IP addresses from  connecting to the Cisco IOS device.\r\n\r\n\r\n    access-list 152 deny   tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 21\n    access-list 152 deny   tcp TRUSTED_ADDRESSES MASK any eq 20     access-list 152 permit tcp any any eq 20     access-list 152 permit tcp any any eq 21     access-list 152 deny    ip any any     !     class-map match-all COPP-KNOWN-UNDESIRABLE      match access-group 152     !     !     policy-map COPP-INPUT-POLICY      class COPP-KNOWN-UNDESIRABLE       drop     !     control-plane      service-policy input COPP-INPUT-POLICY\r\n\r\nIn the above CoPP example, the ACL entries that match the exploit  packets with the \"permit\" action result in these packets being discarded by the  policy-map \"drop\" function, while packets that match the \"deny\" action are not  affected by the policy-map drop function.\r\n\r\nCoPP is available in Cisco IOS release trains 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S,  12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T.\r\n\r\nAdditional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature  can be found at the following URL:\r\n\r\n  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html\"]"
