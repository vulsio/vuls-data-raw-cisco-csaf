An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed SIP message to an affected device.  This action could cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a temporary DoS condition. Repeated attacks can result in a persistent DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability with a security advisory and released updated software.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nSuccessful exploitation allows the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, which could be considered a temporary DoS condition.  Repeated attacks could result in a persistent denial of service condition.\r\n\r\nA system is only vulnerable if deep packet inspection of SIP messages is enabled. This is handled by the fixup command in FWSM 2.x and ASA/PIX 6.x, and is enabled for SIP packets by default in these versions.  It is handled by the inspect command in both FWSM 3.x and ASA/PIX 7.x.  The inspect command is enabled by default in FWSM 3.x, and disabled by default in ASA/PIX 7.x.\r\n",
