This issue is compounded by a related  bug which allows traffic to TCP 5060 and UDP port 5060 on devices not  configured for SIP.\r\n\r\nThere are no known instances of intentional exploitation of this issue.  However, Cisco has observed data streams that appear to be unintentionally  triggering the vulnerability.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds exist to mitigate the effects of this problem on devices  which do not require SIP.\r\n  This advisory is posted at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20070131-sip [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20070131-sip\"].",

This includes IOS versions 12.3(4)XH,  12.3(4)XQ, 12.3(7)XR, 12.3(7)XS, 12.3(8)JA, 12.3(8)T, 12.3(8)XU, 12.3(8)XW,  12.3(8)XX, 12.3(8)XY, 12.3(8)YA, 12.3(8)YG, 12.3(8)YH, 12.3(8)YI, 12.3(8)ZA,  12.4 Mainline and 12.4T onward. Routers configured as SIP Public Switched  Telephone Network (PSTN) Gateways are vulnerable, as are routers configured as  SIP Session Border Controllers (SBCs) and the CAT6000-CMM card.\r\n\r\nTo determine if your device has SIP enabled, enter the commands  show ip sockets and show tcp brief  all. Below is an example of a router running code without the  fix, and without the workaround enabled. The router in this example is running  the vulnerable image c7200-p-mz.124-3.bin:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show ip sockets\r\nProto    Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out Stat TTY OutputIF  17 0.0.0.0             0  --any--          5060   0   0  211   0  17 0.0.0.0             0 192.168.100.2       67   0   0 2211   0  17 0.0.0.0             0 192.168.100.2     2517   0   0   11   0\r\n\r\nThe first line with UDP Port 5060 shows that UDP SIP is enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show tcp brief all\r\nTCB       Local Address           Foreign Address        (state)  2051E680  *.5060                  *.*                    LISTEN\r\n\r\nThe above lines with *.5060 show that TCP SIP is enabled.",

To confirm that a device is not vulnerable to this issue, ensure  that ports TCP 5060 and UDP 5060 are not open on the device with the commands  show tcp brief all and show ip  sockets.

				"text": "SIP is a protocol designed for use in IP voice networks and is widely  used for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communications worldwide.\r\n\r\nCisco devices running certain versions of IOS with support for SIP  services may be affected by a vulnerability that leads to a reload of the  device with a crafted series of SIP packets to either TCP port 5060 or UDP port  5060. This vulnerability affects routers that contain any SIP configuration,  including SIP gateways. This issue is being tracked as Cisco Bug ID  CSCsh58082 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsh58082\"]  (  registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)  .\r\n\r\nIn addition, certain versions of IOS with support for SIP services may  process SIP messages even if they are not configured for SIP operation. To  process SIP messages IOS will open UDP port 5060 and TCP port 5060 for  listening. The Cisco Bug ID that documents the issue of IOS processing SIP  messages without being configured for SIP operation is  CSCsb25337 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsb25337\"]  (  registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)  . The fix for this bug turns off the  listening ports TCP 5060 and UDP 5060.\r\n\r\nA device must have an open SIP port to be vulnerable to this issue.  Devices which do not listen on TCP 5060 or UDP 5060 are not vulnerable. Because  SIP utilizes UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP  address, which may defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from  trusted IP addresses.",

				"text": "Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the  network are available in the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion  document for this advisory:  http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20070131-sip [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20070131-sip\"].\r\n  Disable SIP listening ports\r\nFor devices which do not require SIP to be enabled, the simplest and  most effective workaround is to disable SIP processing on the device with the  following commands.\r\n\r\n  Warning: When applying this workaround to devices  which are processing MGCP or H.323 calls, the device will not allow you to stop  SIP processing while active calls are being processed. Under these  circumstances, this workaround should be implemented during a maintenance  window when active calls can be briefly stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\r\nRouter(config)#sip-ua  Router(config-sip-ua)#no transport udp  Router(config-sip-ua)#no transport tcp  Router(config-sip-ua)#end\r\n\r\nAfter applying this workaround the commands show ip  sockets and show tcp brief all will  not show the device listening on UDP and TCP port 5060:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show ip sockets\r\nProto    Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out Stat TTY   17   --listen--          9.13.32.18       2887   0   0   11   0    Router#show tcp brief all  TCB       Local Address           Foreign Address        (state)  6649A5A4  *.1720                  *.*                    LISTEN  66CDC764  *.1723                  *.*                    LISTEN\r\n    Control Plane Policing\r\nFor devices which do not need to run SIP, you can use Control Plane  Policing (CoPP) to block all SIP access to the device. Cisco IOS software  releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature.  CoPP may be configured on a device to protect the management and control planes  to minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by  explicitly permitting only authorized traffic sent to infrastructure devices in  accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The following  example can be adapted to your network.\r\n\r\n  Warning: Because SIP utilizes UDP as a transport, it  is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that permit  communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n!-- Permit all TCP and UDP SIP traffic sent to all IP addresses  !-- configured on all interfaces of the affected device so that it  !-- will be policed and dropped by the CoPP feature.      access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5060  access-list 100 permit udp any any eq 5060      !-- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4  !-- traffic in accordance with existing security policies and  !-- configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent  !-- to infrastructure devices.        !-- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by  !-- the CoPP feature.      class-map match-all drop-sip-class    match access-group 100      !-- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the  !-- Control-Plane of the device.      policy-map drop-sip-traffic    class drop-sip-class      drop      !-- Apply the Policy-Map to the Control-Plane of the  !-- device.      control-plane    service-policy input drop-sip-traffic\r\n\r\nIn the above CoPP example, the access control list entries (ACEs) which  match the potential exploit packets with the \"permit\" action result in these  packets being discarded by the policy-map \"drop\" function, while packets that  match the \"deny\" action (not shown) are not affected by the policy-map drop  function. Additional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP  feature can be found at  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6642/prod_white_paper0900aecd804fa16a.html\"]  and  http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gtrtlimt.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gtrtlimt.html\"].",

Under these  circumstances, this workaround should be implemented during a maintenance  window when active calls can be briefly stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\r\nRouter(config)#sip-ua  Router(config-sip-ua)#no transport udp  Router(config-sip-ua)#no transport tcp  Router(config-sip-ua)#end\r\n\r\nAfter applying this workaround the commands show ip  sockets and show tcp brief all will  not show the device listening on UDP and TCP port 5060:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show ip sockets\r\nProto    Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out Stat TTY   17   --listen--          9.13.32.18       2887   0   0   11   0    Router#show tcp brief all  TCB       Local Address           Foreign Address        (state)  6649A5A4  *.1720                  *.*                    LISTEN  66CDC764  *.1723                  *.*                    LISTEN\r\n    Control Plane Policing\r\nFor devices which do not need to run SIP, you can use Control Plane  Policing (CoPP) to block all SIP access to the device. Cisco IOS software  releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature.  CoPP may be configured on a device to protect the management and control planes  to minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by  explicitly permitting only authorized traffic sent to infrastructure devices in  accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The following  example can be adapted to your network.\r\n\r\n  Warning: Because SIP utilizes UDP as a transport, it  is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that permit  communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n!-- Permit all TCP and UDP SIP traffic sent to all IP addresses  !-- configured on all interfaces of the affected device so that it  !-- will be policed and dropped by the CoPP feature.      access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5060  access-list 100 permit udp any any eq 5060      !-- Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4  !-- traffic in accordance with existing security policies and  !-- configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent  !-- to infrastructure devices.        !-- Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by  !-- the CoPP feature.      class-map match-all drop-sip-class    match access-group 100      !-- Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the  !-- Control-Plane of the device.      policy-map drop-sip-traffic    class drop-sip-class      drop      !-- Apply the Policy-Map to the Control-Plane of the  !-- device.      control-plane    service-policy input drop-sip-traffic\r\n\r\nIn the above CoPP example, the access control list entries (ACEs) which  match the potential exploit packets with the \"permit\" action result in these  packets being discarded by the policy-map \"drop\" function, while packets that  match the \"deny\" action (not shown) are not affected by the policy-map drop  function.
