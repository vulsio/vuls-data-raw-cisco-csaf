				"text": "Cisco VPN Client for Windows version 5.0.02.0090 contains a vulnerability that could allow a local attacker to cause the affected system to fail and restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists due to invalid memory operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a program designed to make malicious requests to the affected application. As a result of processing these requests, the application could corrupt system memory,causing the system to fail and restart, thus denying service to legitimate users.\r\n\r\nProof-of-concept code exists that demonstrates a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has not confirmed this vulnerability and updates are not available.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAn attacker must log on locally to an affected system and run a program designed to submit malicious input to the affected application.  An exploit could cause the system to fail and restart, resulting in a DoS condition.  No evidence exists demonstrating that memory corruption resulting from an exploit could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.\r\n\r\nSystems that could be most impacted by an exploit are multi-user systems.  Because VPN client software is often deployed on dedicated or single-user systems, a DoS may only affect the attacker or one other user on the local system.\r\n",
