Anonymous authentication is  used when Cisco Unity servers are authenticated to the subscriber instead of  Microsoft Windows (Integrated Windows authentication). By default, Cisco Unity  is configured so that the administrator uses the Integrated Windows  authentication method for authentication.\r\n\r\n Details on authentication mechanisms can be found in the  Installation Guide for Cisco Unity in the  Authentication  Methods Available for the Cisco Unity Administrator [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/unity/5x/installation/guide/umexnofo/5xcuigumenofo100.html#wp1533581\"] section.\r\n\r\n This authentication bypass vulnerability allows an  unauthenticated user the ability to view or modify some system configuration  parameters. No credentials, personally identifiable, or user information can be  obtained through exploitation of this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID   CSCsr86943  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCsr86943\"]            ( registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)          and has been assigned  Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2008-3814.",
