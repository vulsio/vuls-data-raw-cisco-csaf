An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly entering the report view URL into their browser. An exploit could allow the attacker to view potentially sensitive information that they have not be given explicit access to view.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must authenticate to a targeted system. This access requirement limits the possibility of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers are advised to review the bug report in the \"Vendor Announcements\" section for a current list of affected versions.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
