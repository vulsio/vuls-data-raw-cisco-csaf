The Cisco TelePresence Infrastructure solution includes MCU products includes Cisco TelePresence MCU products which are a range of advanced MCUs that are designed to combine continuous presence with high-definition video and voice quality, and Cisco TelePresence Server which connects users to a wide range of\r\nendpoints and multivendor telepresence systems.\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the digital signal processor (DSP) card could allow\r\nan unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash of the DSP card which will\r\ntrigger a reload of the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due\r\nto insufficient validation of a malformed H.264 bit stream that is transported in a Real-Time Transport Protocol\r\n(RTP) packet payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\r\ninjecting RTP packets with a malformed H.264 bit stream into an established Session Initiation\r\nProtocol (SIP) or H.323 session. An exploit could allow the attacker to\r\ncause the reload of the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is described in Cisco bug IDs CSCuc11328[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc11328\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence Server and CSCub05448[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub05448\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco TelePresence MCU Series devices.
