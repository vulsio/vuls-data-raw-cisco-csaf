An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing crafted arguments to the install license command.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly users who could access a device and authenticate with sufficient privileges to execute the vulnerable command could exploit this vulnerability. The access requirement greatly limits the sources of potential attacks.",
