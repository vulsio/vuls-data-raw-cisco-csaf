				"text": "The Portable Software Developer Kit (SDK) for Universal Plug-n-Play (UPnP) Devices contains a libupnp library, originally known as the Intel SDK for UPnP Devices, which is vulnerable to multiple stack-based buffer overflows when handling malicious Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) requests. This library is used in several vendor network devices, in addition to media streaming and file sharing applications. These vulnerabilities were disclosed on January 29th, 2013 in a CERT Vulnerability Note, VU#922681, which can be viewed at http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681[\"http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/922681\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco is currently evaluating products for possible exposure to these vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130129-upnp[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130129-upnp\"]",

				"text": "UPnP™ is an architecture that enables discovery, event notification, and control of devices on a network, independent of operating system, programming language, or physical network connection. UPnP™ is based on common Internet standards and specifications such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and XML.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Portable SDK for UPnP Devices is affected by at least three remotely exploitable buffer overflows. These vulnerabilities can be exploited in the processing of incoming SSDP requests on UDP port 1900. CERT released the following CVE IDs to document these vulnerabilities: CVE-2012-5958, CVE-2012-5959, CVE-2012-5960, CVE-2012-5961, CVE-2012-5962, CVE-2012-5963, CVE-2012-5964, and CVE-2012-5965.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following Cisco bug IDs are being used to track potential exposure to the UPnP issues. The bugs listed below do not confirm that a product is vulnerable, but rather that the product is under investigation by the appropriate product teams.\n\r\n\n\r\nRegistered Cisco customers can view these bugs via the Cisco Bug Toolkit: http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl[\"http://www.cisco.com/pcgi-bin/Support/Bugtool/launch_bugtool.pl\"]\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Product\r\n            Bug ID\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco AP541N Wireless Access Point\r\n            CSCue19294\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco NSS300 Series Smart Storage**\r\n            CSCue19395\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco PVC2300 Business Internet Video Camera** \r\n            CSCue21009\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco RV0XX Series Routers**\r\n            CSCue20980\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall\r\n            CSCue20983\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall\r\n            CSCue20983\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco RVL200 VPN Router**\r\n            CSCue20989\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco RVS4000 Gigabit Security Router**\r\n            CSCue20997\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco Small Business ISA500 Series Integrated Security Appliances\r\n            CSCue19341\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco Small Business SA500 Series Security Appliances\r\n            CSCue21031\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco TelePresence C Series Endpoints\r\n            CSCue19318\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco TelePresence System EX Series\r\n            CSCue19318\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco TelePresence SX20\r\n            CSCue19318\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WAP4400N Wireless-N Access Point\r\n            CSCue21567\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WET200 Wireless-G Business Ethernet Bridge\r\n            CSCue21572\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router**\r\n            CSCue21578\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WRV200 Wireless-G VPN Router**\r\n            CSCue21578\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n**NOTE: This product is no longer being sold and might not be supported. \n\r\n\n\r\nView the NSS3000 End-of-Life Notice at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/ps4159/ps9954/ps9957/end_of_life_c51_606545.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/ps4159/ps9954/ps9957/end_of_life_c51_606545.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nView the PVC2300 End-of-Life Notice at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/vpndevc/ps6918/ps9692/ps9944/end_of_life_notice_c51-685005.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/vpndevc/ps6918/ps9692/ps9944/end_of_life_notice_c51-685005.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nView the RV Series Routers End-of-Life Notices at http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9923/prod_eol_notices_list.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9923/prod_eol_notices_list.html\"]",
