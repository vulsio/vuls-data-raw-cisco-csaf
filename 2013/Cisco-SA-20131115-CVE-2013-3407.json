An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly browsing to the vulnerable pages.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, it is likely that an attacker would need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside, which may decrease the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
