An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a script as the SSID of a rogue access point. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to to execute scripts in the browser of a user viewing the malicious SSID.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would likely need access to a trusted, internal network in order to use a malicious script as the SSID of a rogue access point or have the knowledge of whether rogue access points exist in the network.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers are advised to review the bug reports in the \"Vendor Announcements\" section for a current list of affected versions.",
