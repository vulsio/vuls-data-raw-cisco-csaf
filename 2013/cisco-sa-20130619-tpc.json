An attacker could exploit both vulnerabilities by sending crafted SIP packets to the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe first vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue01743[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue01743\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3377.\n\r\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause a reload of the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe second vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuf89557[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf89557\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3378.\n\r\nSuccessful exploitation of this vulnerability may cause the affected system to become unresponsive for a certain amount of time. Repeated exploitation may lead to a denial of service condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence TC Software Adjacent root Access Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the implementation of firewall rules could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to gain root shell access to an affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper implementation of allowed hosts in the firewall rules. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the management IP address of the affected system. The attacker would need to be logically or physically adjacent to exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain root access to the shell.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCts37781[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts37781\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3379.",
