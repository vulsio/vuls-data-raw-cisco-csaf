An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the files to acquire credentials and using them to access internal application components, such as the database.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAn attacker would need to authenticate and have local access to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful attack.",
