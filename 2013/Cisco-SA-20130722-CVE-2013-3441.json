				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Aironet 3600 Series Access Point could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a denial of service condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a memory corruption condition that could occur when the device switches between FlexConnect and Standalone mode. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by disrupting the communications path between a configured and provisioned FlexConnect access point and the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the access point to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition forcing the device to restart. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis issue has been observed to occur when a switch between FlexConnect and Standalone mode transpires frequently during a 24 to 48 hour period.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
