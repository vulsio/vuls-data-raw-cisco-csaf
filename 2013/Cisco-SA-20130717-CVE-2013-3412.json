				"text": "A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communication Manager (Unified CM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute a blind Structured Query Language (SQL) injection.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied requests by the Cisco Unified CM. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting SQL commands, which could allow the attacker to insert rows within the database.\n\r\n\n\r\nProof-of-concept code that demonstrates an exploit of this vulnerability is publicly available.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security advisory; however, software updates are not yet available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires authenticated access to the targeted system. Authenticated access may require the attacker to access trusted, internal networks. These access requirements could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified CM version 8.0 reached the End of Software Maintenance on October 23, 2012. Customers using Cisco Unified CM 8.0(x) versions should contact their Cisco support team for assistance in upgrading to a supported version of Cisco Unified CM.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified CM is the only product confirmed to be vulnerable. Additional voice products may be affected by one or more of the individual vulnerabilities that are described in the advisory. The following products are being investigated but have not yet been confirmed as vulnerable:\n\r\n\r\n     Cisco Emergency Responder\r\n     Cisco Unified Contact Center Express\r\n     Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal\r\n     Cisco Unified Presence Server/Cisco IM and Presence Service\r\n     Cisco Unity Connection\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited over the default management ports, TCP port 8080 or 8443.",
