				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Management Controller of the Cisco Unified Computing System could allow an authenticated, local attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper parameter input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing invalid parameters to the MCTools application, causing the MCServer application to terminate. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to authenticate and have local access to the targeted device. These access requirements limits the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
