An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security bug report. However, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions in an attempt to persuade the user to follow the malicious link.",
