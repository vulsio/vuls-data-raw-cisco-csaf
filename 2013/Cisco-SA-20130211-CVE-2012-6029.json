An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious URL. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session in the security context of the site that is hosted by the affected software.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.",
