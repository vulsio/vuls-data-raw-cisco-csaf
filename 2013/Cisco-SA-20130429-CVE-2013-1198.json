				"text": "Cisco Unified Computing System Central Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software fails to perform sufficient validation and sanitation of user-supplied input when processing crafted URLs. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site and allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and has released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions in an attempt to persuade a user to follow the malicious link.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor additional information about cross-site scripting attacks and potential methods of mitigation, see the Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin Understanding Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Threat Vectors[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20060922-understanding-xss\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
