				"text": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of the Network Address Translation (NAT) process by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to the targeted device. If successful, an attacker could cause a delay in new valid connections until the invalid entries expire, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, mitigations for this vulnerability are available.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/Cisco-SA-20130226-CVE-2013-1138[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/Cisco-SA-20130226-CVE-2013-1138\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
