				"text": "The Cisco TelePresence VX Clinical Assistant is an easy-to-use, high-definition, video collaboration system that is designed for mobility at the point of care. The Cisco TelePresence VX Clinical Assistant is ideal for a variety of medical uses, including remote patient consultations, virtual care, and medical education. It gives healthcare facilities the chance to bring the benefits of telepresence to patients and employees.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco TelePresence VX Clinical Assistant is intended to facilitate remote provider/patient and provider/provider consultations. These consultations should always be conducted with a licensed medical professional physically in the room.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the WIL-A module of Cisco TelePresence VX Clinical Assistant could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in as the admin user of the device using a blank password.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a coding error that resets the password for the admin user to a blank password on every reboot. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the administrative interface as the admin user with a blank password.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability will reset the password for the \"admin\" user to a blank password on every reboot whether a password has been set for the user or not. Any passwords configured for the \"admin\" user remain valid only until the next system reboot, when it will be overwritten by a blank password. Password for other users on the system are not impacted by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCuj17238[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuj17238\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5558.",
