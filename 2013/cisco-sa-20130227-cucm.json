This vulnerability is triggered by receiving malformed packets on unused UDP ports and couldÂ result in an inability to connect to the graphical user interface (GUI) and an interruption of voice services.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtx43337[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx43337\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities Enumerator (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1133. This vulnerability applies to Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 8.6(x) and above and is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 9.0(1), 8.6(4) BE3k and 8.6(2a)su2. Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1(x) and 8.5(x) versions are not affected.\n\r\n\n\r\nLocation Bandwidth Manager (LBM) Cache Poisoning Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0 contains a vulnerability\r\nthat could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to poison the\r\nLocation Bandwidth Manager (LBM) transaction records.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability is due to a lack of authentication of the remote LBM Hub\r\nnode in the Intracluster communication between LBMs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by poisoning the LBM transaction records to consume all available bandwidth pools.  An\r\nexploit could allow the attacker to consume all bandwidth and deny\r\ncalls. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCub28920[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub28920\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1134. This vulnerability applies to Cisco Unified Communications Manager version 9.0(x) only and is fixed in Cisco Unified Communications Manager versions 9.1(1). Cisco Unified Communications Manager 7.1(x), 8.5(x) and 8.6(x) versions are not affected.",
