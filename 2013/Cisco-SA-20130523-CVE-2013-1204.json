				"text": "A vulnerability in the SNMP process on Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected process and a limited memory leak that affects the process.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to not freeing allocated memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of UDP packets to SNMP port 162 on the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a limited memory leak that affects only the SNMP process. The attacker could also cause a repeated reload of the affected process.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted requests to the affected software. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
