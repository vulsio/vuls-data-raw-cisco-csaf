				"text": "Cisco Unified MeetingPlace is an on-premises conferencing solution that allows organizations to host integrated voice, video,\r\nand web conferencing. The solution is integrated directly into an organization's private voice/data networks\r\nand enterprise applications. Cisco Unified MeetingPlace servers can be\r\ndeployed so that the server is accessible from the Internet, allowing\r\nexternal parties to participate in meetings.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server is the core of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace solution and provides voice and video services, and general support to other components of the solution. Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web\r\nConferencing Server is a component of the Cisco  Unified MeetingPlace solution that allows users to manage meetings and share  applications and\r\npresentations.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the authentication code of the webserver component of Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take over a user session after the user has logged out from the affected system.\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the affected system not invalidating a user's session when the user logs out. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP GET or POST request and sending it to the affected system. To succeed, the attacker must know the session cookie value from a user that has previously logged out. The Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Application Server will automatically invalidate the session cookie after 30 minutes; therefore the attacker has 30 minutes to perform attack.  An exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate a legitimate user and compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system with the privileges of that user.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc64885[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc64885\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1168.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Server Arbitrary Login Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the authentication code of the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impersonate a legitimate user and issue arbitrary commands to the affected system.\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient verification of the user cookies when the Remember Me option is configured on the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a login request and send it to the affected system. The attacker must know a valid user name to execute the attack. An exploit\r\ncould allow the attacker to impersonate a legitimate user and compromise the\r\nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system with\r\nthe privileges of that user.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: this vulnerability affects only Cisco Unified  MeetingPlace Web Conferencing servers that are configured with the Remember Me option. Microsoft Outlook Integration is using the Cisco Unified  MeetingPlace Application Server for authentication services, and it is not affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc64846[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc64846\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1169.",
