				"text": "IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nTo be vulnerable, Cisco ASA Software must have at least one IPsec VPN tunnel with active traffic passing through the tunnel. This vulnerability cannot be exploited if offending packets are flowing through an SSL/TLS based VPN tunnel.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the Cisco ASA Software is configured for IPsec VPN use, the command show running-config crypto map and verify that a crypto map is applied to at least one interface of the Cisco ASA. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with a crypto map called outside_map that is applied to the outside interface:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# sh running-config crypto map\r\n[...]\r\ncrypto map outside_map interface outside\r\n  Note: Cisco ASA Software does not have a crypto map applied by default to any interface.\r\n\r\nSQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if SQL*Net inspection is enabled.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the SQL*Net inspection is enabled, use the show service-policy | include sqlnet command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with SQL*Net inspection enabled:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show  service-policy | include sqlnet\r\n  Inspect: sqlnet, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0\r\n    Note: SQL*Net inspection is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nDigital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability in either of the following cases:\r\nClientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN is configured to use digital certificate authentication\r\nCisco ASDM is configured to use digital certificate authentication\r\n  To determine whether the Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN is configured to use digital certificate authentication, use the show runing-config webvpn command. To verify if digital certificate authentication is enabled for the VPN features,  use the show running-config tunnel-group <Tunnel_Group_Name> where <Tunnel_Group_Name> is the tunnel group associated to the Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN profiles, and verify that the authentication certificate or authentication aaacertificate command is present under the tunnel-group webvpn-attributes.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN feature enabled on the outside interface and with certificate authentication enabled under the tunnel-group named AnyConnect-TG:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn\r\n    webvpn       enable outside        ciscoasa# show running-config tunnel-group AnyConnect-TG      [...]      tunnel-group DefaultRAGroup webvpn-attributes       authentication aaa certificate\r\n    To determine whether Cisco ASDM is configured to use digital certificate authentication, use the show running-config http command and verify that both http server enabled and http authentication-certificate  <Interface_name> commands are present. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with Cisco ASDM and certificate authentication enabled on the inside interface:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa# show running-config http\r\n    http server enable      [...]      http authentication-certificate inside\r\n    On some Cisco ASA versions, the command ssl certificate-authentication interface <Interface_name> port <Port_Number> was used instead of the http authentication-certificate <Interface_name> command.\r\n\r\nNote: Digital certificate authentication is disabled by default. This vulnerability does not affect Cisco ASA 5505, Cisco ASA 5510, Cisco ASA 5520, Cisco ASA 5540, and Cisco ASA 5550 products.\r\n\r\nRemote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:\r\nIt is configured for either Clientless or AnyConnect VPN, IKEv1 and IKEv2 Remote IPsec VPN and L2TP/IPsec VPN\r\nThe remote VPN is authenticated via a remote AAA server using LDAP\r\nThe override-account-disable option is configured under the tunnel-group general-attributes settings.\r\n  Cisco ASA Software using any other remote AAA server or local AAA server for authentication of remote VPN is not affected by this vulnerability. Additionally, Cisco ASA Software configured for LAN-to-LAN IPsec VPN is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether an LDAP AAA server and the override-account-disable command are configured under the tunnel-group general-attributes settings, use the show running-config tunnel-group <Tunnel_Group_Name> command.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows Cisco ASA Software configured to authenticate a remote VPN session using the tunnel-group AnyConnect-TG via a remote AAA server called AAA-LDAP-SERVER and with the override-account-disable option enabled:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config tunnel-group AnyConnect-TG\r\ntunnel-group test general-attributes   authentication-server-group AAA-LDAP-SERVER   override-account-disable\r\n    Additionally, use the show aaa-server protocol ldap command to verify that the remote AAA server associated to the tunnel-group is an LDAP server.  The following example shows a Cisco ASA configured with a AAA server called AAA-LDAP-SERVER running over LDAP:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show aaa-server protocol ldap\r\nServer Group:    AAA-LDAP-SERVER\r\nServer Protocol: ldap\r\n[...]\r\n  Note: The override-account-disable command is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nDigital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the digital certificate client authentication is enabled for Cisco ASDM. Use the show running-config http command to verify that the authentication-certificate <Interface_Name> command is configured. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the http authentication-certificate command enabled on the inside interface:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa# show running-config http\r\n    http server enable      [...]      http authentication-certificate inside\r\n    On some Cisco ASA versions, the command ssl certificate-authentication interface <Interface_name>port <Port_Number> was used instead of the http authentication-certificate <Interface_name> command.\r\n\r\nNote: Digital certificate authentication is disabled by default for Cisco ASDM.\r\n\r\nHTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if HTTP Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is configured with any of the following options:\r\nThe spoof-server parameters option is enabled\r\nThe mask option is enabled and is inspecting the HTTP response with active-x in the body\r\nThe mask option is enabled and is inspecting the HTTP response with java-applet in the body\r\n  To determine whether any of these configurations are present, use the show running-config policy-map type inspect http command. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software configured with a HTTP DPI policy called HTTP_DPI_PM with the spoof-server option enabled:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config policy-map type inspect http\r\n!  policy-map type inspect http HTTP_DPI_PM   parameters    spoof-server \"Apache\"\r\n !\r\n    Note: The HTTP inspection engine and HTTP DPI are disabled by default. This vulnerability does not affect Cisco ASA 5505, Cisco ASA 5510, Cisco ASA 5520, Cisco ASA 5540, and Cisco ASA 5550 products.\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the DNS Application Layer Protocol Inspection (ALPI) engine is configured to inspect DNS packets over TCP.\r\n\r\nTo verify if the DNS ALPI engine is inspecting DNS packets over TCP, use the show running-config access-list <acl_name> command where acl_name is the name of the access-list used in the class-map to which the DNS inspection is applied.\r\n\r\nThis can be found by using the show running-config class-map and show running-config policy-map commands.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the DNS ALPI engine configured to inspect DNS packets over TCP.\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config access-list\r\n[...]  access-list DNS_INSPECT_ACL extended permit tcp any any  [...]\r\n  OR\r\nciscoasa# show running-config access-list\r\n[...]  access-list DNS_INSPECT_ACL extended permit ip any any  [...]  ciscoasa# show running-config class-map  !  class-map DNS_INSPECT_CP   match access-list DNS_INSPECT  [...]  ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map  !  policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map   parameters    message-length maximum client auto    message-length maximum 512  policy-map global_policy   class inspection_default    inspect ftp    inspect h323 h225    [...]   class DNS_INSPECT_CP    inspect dns preset_dns_map  !\r\n    Note: Cisco ASA Software will not inspect DNS packets over TCP by default.\r\n\r\nAnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is vulnerable if AnyConnect SSL VPN is configured. Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless SSL VPN, IKEv1/IKEv2 IPsec remote and LAN-to-LAN VPN, or L2TP/IPsec VPN is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether Cisco ASA Software is configured with AnyConnect SSL VPN, use the show running-config webvpn and verify that the svc enble or anyconnect enable (as of Cisco ASA Software version 8.4(1)) command is present.\r\n\r\nThe  following example shows Cisco ASA Software with AnyConnect SSL VPN feature enabled:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config webvpn\r\nwebvpn   [...]   svc enable\r\n    Note: AnyConnect SSL VPN is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nSSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is vulnerable if Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN is configured. Cisco ASA Software configured for IKEv1/IKEv2 IPsec remote and LAN-to-LAN VPN, or L2TP/IPsec VPN is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo determine if SSL VPN is enabled use the show running-config webvpn command.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the SSL VPN feature enabled on the outside interface:\r\nciscoasa# show running-config webvpn\r\n     webvpn       enable outside\r\n    Note: SSL VPN is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nCrafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is vulnerable if the ICMP inspection engine is configured to inspect ICMP packets that are traversing the firewall or if ICMP packets targeting firewall interfaces are allowed to be processed\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of the Cisco ASA Software is to allow and process all ICMP traffic to the firewall interfaces, meaning that default Cisco ASA Software configuration is vulnerable. The default ICMP policy is not visible in the firewall configuration; however this default ICMP policy can be disabled by using the commands icmp deny any <interface_name> and ipv6 icmp deny any <interface_name> if IP version 6 is enabled on the interface. If any of these two commands are configured they will be visible in the configuration. To determine if the default ICMP policy is disabled, use the show running-config icmp | include deny any command and verify that output is returned for each of the interfaces configured on the firewall. If there are any IPv6 enabled interfaces, to verify that the default ICMP policy is disabled for ICMPv6 use the show running-config ipv6 | include icmp deny any command and verify that output is returned for each of the IPv6 enabled interfaces configured on the firewall. Administrators should consider the system vulnerable if the command returns an empty output or the output shows that the configuration is applied on a subset of the firewall interfaces.\r\n\r\nTo determine if any non-default ICMP interface policy is configured on a device in such a way that permits certain ICMP packets destined to the firewall, use the show running-config icmp | include permit and show running-config ipv6 | include icmp permit command and verify the output that is returned for for each of the interfaces configured on the firewall.\r\nAdministrators should consider the system vulnerable if the command shows that the configuration permitting ICMP packets is applied on a subset of the firewall interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows Cisco ASA Software with non-default ICMP policy configured to permit ICMP echo-reply packets destined to the ASA firewall outside interface.\r\nciscoasa#show running-config icmp | include permit\r\nicmp permit any echo-reply outside\r\nicmp permit any echo-reply dmz1\r\nicmp permit any unreachable outside  icmp permit any echo outside\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa#show running-config ipv6 | include permit icmp\r\nipv6 icmp permit any echo outside\r\nipv6 icmp permit any echo-reply outside\r\nipv6 icmp permit any neighbor-advertisement outside\r\n\r\nTo verify if the ICMP inspect engine is configured to inspect ICMP packets traversing the firewall, use the show running-config | include inspect icmp command and verify that inspect icmp command is present. Configuration where only inspect icmp error is configured is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the ICMP inspection engine configured to inspect ICMP packets traversing the ASA firewall.\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config | include inspect icmp\r\ninspect icmp\r\n\r\nNote: ICMP inspection engine is not enabled by default.\r\nDetermining the Running Software Version  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the show version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco ASA Software version 8.4(1):\r\n\r\nciscoasa#show version | include Version\r\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1)\r\nDevice Manager Version 6.4(1)\r\n  Customers who use Cisco ASDM to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.",

				"text": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is the operating system used by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, the Cisco ASA 5500-X Next Generation Firewall, the Cisco ASA Services Module (ASASM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, and the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall. The Cisco ASA family provides network security services such as firewall, intrusion prevention system (IPS), anti-X, and VPN.\r\n\r\nIPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in IPsec code  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an error in the code that decrypts packets transiting an active VPN tunnel. In particular the code is failing at properly handling crafted ICMP packets after a decryption operation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted ICMP packets through an active VPN tunnel. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the device that performs the decryption operation.\r\n\r\nNote: Only ICMP traffic passing through an active IPsec VPN tunnel can trigger this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed mode in both single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by ICMP and ICMPv6 packets.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue18975 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue18975\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5507.\r\n\r\nSQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in SQL*Net inspection engine code could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of segmented Transparent Network Substrate (TNS) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted sequence of segmented TNS packets through the affected system.\r\n\r\nNote: Only transit traffic that is inspected by the Cisco ASA SQL*Net inspection engine can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) traffic.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub98434 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub98434\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5508.\r\n\r\nDigital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the code for SSL certificate validation of the Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the certificate authentication.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an error in handling a client crafted certificate during the authentication phase. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to authenticate to the affected system using a crafted certificate. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the certificate authentication. Depending on the Cisco ASA configuration, this may allow the attacker to authenticate and access the network via Clientless or Anyconnect SSL VPN or to get administrative management access via Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM).\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured for client digital certificate authentication for Clientless and AnyConnect SSL VPN or for remote management via Cisco ASDM.\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software running on Cisco ASA 5505, Cisco ASA 5510, Cisco ASA 5520, Cisco ASA 5540, and Cisco ASA 5550 is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNote: Only traffic directed to the affected device can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A TCP three-way handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuf52468 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf52468\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5509.\r\n\r\nRemote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the authentication code of the remote access VPN feature of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the remote VPN authentication, which could allow remote access to the inside network.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper parsing of the LDAP response packet received from a remote AAA LDAP server when the override-account-disable option is configured in the general-attributes of the tunnel-group. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate via remote VPN to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the authentication and gain access to the network via remote VPN.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN, IKEv1 and IKEv2 Remote IPsec VPN and L2TP/IPsec VPN. Additionally an external AAA LDAP server should be in use for remote VPN authentication service. Cisco ASA Software using any other protocol for remote AAA service or local AAA server for authentication of remote VPN is not affected by this vulnerability. Cisco ASA Software configured for LAN-to-LAN VPN is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nFor Cisco ASA Software configured with IKEv1 Remote IPsec VPN and L2TP/IPsec VPN the attacker must have knowledge of the tunnel-group password or hold a valid digital certificate in order to exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, an attacker must know a valid username to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNote: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured only in routed firewall mode in only single context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by  IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCug83401 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug83401\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5510.\r\n\r\nDigital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the authentication code of remote management via Cisco Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the digital certificate authentication. Depending on the configuration, this may allow the attacker to remotely connect as administrator to the management interface via Cisco ASDM and take full control of the affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an error in the implementation of the authentication-certificate option, which enables client-side digital certificate authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to authenticate to an interface of the affected system where Cisco ASDM is enabled.\r\n\r\nNote: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A TCP three-way handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh44815 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh44815\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5511.\r\n\r\nHTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in HTTP Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) code could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of a race condition when the HTTP DPI engine is inspecting HTTP packets and either the spoof-server parameters option is enabled or the Cisco ASA Software is configured to inspect and mask the HTTP response including active-x or java-applet in the response body. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP response through the affected system.\r\n\r\nNote: Only transit traffic that it is inspected by the HTTP DPI engine can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed and transparent firewall mode and single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud37992 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud37992\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-5512.\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the DNS Application Layer Protocol Inspection (ALPI) engine of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of the affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper processing of unsupported DNS over TCP packets by the DNS inspection engine.

				"text": "IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nFor VPN setup involving LAN-to-LAN tunnel, it is possible to avoid the decryption of an offending ICMP packet by implementing a vpn-filer access-list. The following commands will implement an access-list that blocks any ICMP packets flowing through a VPN tunnel that use the DfltGrpPolicy group-policy in both inbound and outbound direction:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL deny icmp any any\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL permit ip any any      ciscoasa(config)# group-policy DfltGrpPolicy attributes      ciscoasa(config-group-policy)# vpn-filter value DENY_ICMP_ACL\r\n    Note: Because the vulnerability is triggered during the decryption operation, this workaround should be implemented on both devices terminating the VPN tunnel. This workaround is ineffective if applied to only on one side of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nFor Cisco remote IPsec VPN there is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nDisabling Cisco ASA SQL*Net inspection will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the SQL*Net inspection that is configured by default:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\n    ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default      ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect sqlnet\r\n    Digital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nRemote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than disabling the override-account-disable option.\r\n\r\nDigital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nHTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than removing the affected option from the HTTP DPI configuration\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can workaround this issue by ensuring that only UDP traffic is sent to the DNS ALPI engine for inspection.\r\n\r\nTo do that, first create an access-list to match only UDP traffic and then create a class-map to match on that access-list. Note that by default the Cisco ASA Software will only inspect DNS over UDP traffic. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software forwarding only UDP port 53 traffic to the DNS ALPI engine.\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config access-list\r\naccess-list DNS_INSPECT extended permit udp any any eq 53    ciscoasa# show running-config class-map  !  class-map DNS_INSPECT_CP   match access-list DNS_INSPECT  [...]    ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map  !  policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map   parameters    message-length maximum client auto    message-length maximum 512  policy-map global_policy   class inspection_default    inspect ftp    inspect h323 h225    [...]    class DNS_INSPECT_CP    inspect dns preset_dns_map  !\r\n    Note: Inspection of DNS traffic over TCP is currently not supported by the Cisco ASA Software. Implementing this workaround does not create any loss in functionality.\r\n\r\nAnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling AnyConnect SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nSSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling the SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nCrafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can disable the default ICMP policy and ICMP inspection engine to work around this vulnerability.\r\nTo disable the default ICMP policy use the icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the configured interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. To disable the default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 use the ipv6 icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the IPv6 enabled interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. The following example shows how to disable the default ICMP policy and default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 on the outside interface\r\nciscoasa(config)# icmp deny any outside\r\nciscoasa(config)# ipv6 icmp deny any outside\r\n  Note: Disabling the ICMP processing on the firewall interface may result in administrators not being able to receive any more information from the firewall via ICMP, which includes ping, traceroute, etc. Disabling the ICMPv6 processing on the firewall interface may result in the firewall not being able to communicate on that interface due to a missing neighbor discovery and neighbor advertisement ICMPv6 packets.\r\n\r\nTo disable the ICMP inspection engine, use the no inspect icmp command within the policy-map applied to the service polices.\r\nThe following example shows how to disable the ICMP inspection engine in the policy-map called global_policy:\r\nciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect icmp",

					"details": "IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nFor VPN setup involving LAN-to-LAN tunnel, it is possible to avoid the decryption of an offending ICMP packet by implementing a vpn-filer access-list. The following commands will implement an access-list that blocks any ICMP packets flowing through a VPN tunnel that use the DfltGrpPolicy group-policy in both inbound and outbound direction:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL deny icmp any any\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL permit ip any any      ciscoasa(config)# group-policy DfltGrpPolicy attributes      ciscoasa(config-group-policy)# vpn-filter value DENY_ICMP_ACL\r\n    Note: Because the vulnerability is triggered during the decryption operation, this workaround should be implemented on both devices terminating the VPN tunnel. This workaround is ineffective if applied to only on one side of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nFor Cisco remote IPsec VPN there is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nDisabling Cisco ASA SQL*Net inspection will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the SQL*Net inspection that is configured by default:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\n    ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default      ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect sqlnet\r\n    Digital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nRemote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than disabling the override-account-disable option.\r\n\r\nDigital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nHTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than removing the affected option from the HTTP DPI configuration\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can workaround this issue by ensuring that only UDP traffic is sent to the DNS ALPI engine for inspection.\r\n\r\nTo do that, first create an access-list to match only UDP traffic and then create a class-map to match on that access-list. Note that by default the Cisco ASA Software will only inspect DNS over UDP traffic. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software forwarding only UDP port 53 traffic to the DNS ALPI engine.\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config access-list\r\naccess-list DNS_INSPECT extended permit udp any any eq 53    ciscoasa# show running-config class-map  !  class-map DNS_INSPECT_CP   match access-list DNS_INSPECT  [...]    ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map  !  policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map   parameters    message-length maximum client auto    message-length maximum 512  policy-map global_policy   class inspection_default    inspect ftp    inspect h323 h225    [...]    class DNS_INSPECT_CP    inspect dns preset_dns_map  !\r\n    Note: Inspection of DNS traffic over TCP is currently not supported by the Cisco ASA Software. Implementing this workaround does not create any loss in functionality.\r\n\r\nAnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling AnyConnect SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nSSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling the SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nCrafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can disable the default ICMP policy and ICMP inspection engine to work around this vulnerability.\r\nTo disable the default ICMP policy use the icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the configured interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. To disable the default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 use the ipv6 icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the IPv6 enabled interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. The following example shows how to disable the default ICMP policy and default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 on the outside interface\r\nciscoasa(config)# icmp deny any outside\r\nciscoasa(config)# ipv6 icmp deny any outside\r\n  Note: Disabling the ICMP processing on the firewall interface may result in administrators not being able to receive any more information from the firewall via ICMP, which includes ping, traceroute, etc. Disabling the ICMPv6 processing on the firewall interface may result in the firewall not being able to communicate on that interface due to a missing neighbor discovery and neighbor advertisement ICMPv6 packets.\r\n\r\nTo disable the ICMP inspection engine, use the no inspect icmp command within the policy-map applied to the service polices.\r\nThe following example shows how to disable the ICMP inspection engine in the policy-map called global_policy:\r\nciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect icmp"

					"details": "IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nFor VPN setup involving LAN-to-LAN tunnel, it is possible to avoid the decryption of an offending ICMP packet by implementing a vpn-filer access-list. The following commands will implement an access-list that blocks any ICMP packets flowing through a VPN tunnel that use the DfltGrpPolicy group-policy in both inbound and outbound direction:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL deny icmp any any\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL permit ip any any      ciscoasa(config)# group-policy DfltGrpPolicy attributes      ciscoasa(config-group-policy)# vpn-filter value DENY_ICMP_ACL\r\n    Note: Because the vulnerability is triggered during the decryption operation, this workaround should be implemented on both devices terminating the VPN tunnel. This workaround is ineffective if applied to only on one side of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nFor Cisco remote IPsec VPN there is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nDisabling Cisco ASA SQL*Net inspection will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the SQL*Net inspection that is configured by default:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\n    ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default      ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect sqlnet\r\n    Digital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nRemote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than disabling the override-account-disable option.\r\n\r\nDigital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nHTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than removing the affected option from the HTTP DPI configuration\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can workaround this issue by ensuring that only UDP traffic is sent to the DNS ALPI engine for inspection.\r\n\r\nTo do that, first create an access-list to match only UDP traffic and then create a class-map to match on that access-list. Note that by default the Cisco ASA Software will only inspect DNS over UDP traffic. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software forwarding only UDP port 53 traffic to the DNS ALPI engine.\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config access-list\r\naccess-list DNS_INSPECT extended permit udp any any eq 53    ciscoasa# show running-config class-map  !  class-map DNS_INSPECT_CP   match access-list DNS_INSPECT  [...]    ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map  !  policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map   parameters    message-length maximum client auto    message-length maximum 512  policy-map global_policy   class inspection_default    inspect ftp    inspect h323 h225    [...]    class DNS_INSPECT_CP    inspect dns preset_dns_map  !\r\n    Note: Inspection of DNS traffic over TCP is currently not supported by the Cisco ASA Software. Implementing this workaround does not create any loss in functionality.\r\n\r\nAnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling AnyConnect SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nSSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling the SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nCrafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can disable the default ICMP policy and ICMP inspection engine to work around this vulnerability.\r\nTo disable the default ICMP policy use the icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the configured interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. To disable the default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 use the ipv6 icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the IPv6 enabled interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. The following example shows how to disable the default ICMP policy and default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 on the outside interface\r\nciscoasa(config)# icmp deny any outside\r\nciscoasa(config)# ipv6 icmp deny any outside\r\n  Note: Disabling the ICMP processing on the firewall interface may result in administrators not being able to receive any more information from the firewall via ICMP, which includes ping, traceroute, etc. Disabling the ICMPv6 processing on the firewall interface may result in the firewall not being able to communicate on that interface due to a missing neighbor discovery and neighbor advertisement ICMPv6 packets.\r\n\r\nTo disable the ICMP inspection engine, use the no inspect icmp command within the policy-map applied to the service polices.\r\nThe following example shows how to disable the ICMP inspection engine in the policy-map called global_policy:\r\nciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect icmp"

					"details": "IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nFor VPN setup involving LAN-to-LAN tunnel, it is possible to avoid the decryption of an offending ICMP packet by implementing a vpn-filer access-list. The following commands will implement an access-list that blocks any ICMP packets flowing through a VPN tunnel that use the DfltGrpPolicy group-policy in both inbound and outbound direction:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL deny icmp any any\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL permit ip any any      ciscoasa(config)# group-policy DfltGrpPolicy attributes      ciscoasa(config-group-policy)# vpn-filter value DENY_ICMP_ACL\r\n    Note: Because the vulnerability is triggered during the decryption operation, this workaround should be implemented on both devices terminating the VPN tunnel. This workaround is ineffective if applied to only on one side of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nFor Cisco remote IPsec VPN there is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nDisabling Cisco ASA SQL*Net inspection will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the SQL*Net inspection that is configured by default:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\n    ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default      ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect sqlnet\r\n    Digital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nRemote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than disabling the override-account-disable option.\r\n\r\nDigital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nHTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than removing the affected option from the HTTP DPI configuration\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can workaround this issue by ensuring that only UDP traffic is sent to the DNS ALPI engine for inspection.\r\n\r\nTo do that, first create an access-list to match only UDP traffic and then create a class-map to match on that access-list. Note that by default the Cisco ASA Software will only inspect DNS over UDP traffic. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software forwarding only UDP port 53 traffic to the DNS ALPI engine.\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config access-list\r\naccess-list DNS_INSPECT extended permit udp any any eq 53    ciscoasa# show running-config class-map  !  class-map DNS_INSPECT_CP   match access-list DNS_INSPECT  [...]    ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map  !  policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map   parameters    message-length maximum client auto    message-length maximum 512  policy-map global_policy   class inspection_default    inspect ftp    inspect h323 h225    [...]    class DNS_INSPECT_CP    inspect dns preset_dns_map  !\r\n    Note: Inspection of DNS traffic over TCP is currently not supported by the Cisco ASA Software. Implementing this workaround does not create any loss in functionality.\r\n\r\nAnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling AnyConnect SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nSSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling the SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nCrafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can disable the default ICMP policy and ICMP inspection engine to work around this vulnerability.\r\nTo disable the default ICMP policy use the icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the configured interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. To disable the default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 use the ipv6 icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the IPv6 enabled interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. The following example shows how to disable the default ICMP policy and default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 on the outside interface\r\nciscoasa(config)# icmp deny any outside\r\nciscoasa(config)# ipv6 icmp deny any outside\r\n  Note: Disabling the ICMP processing on the firewall interface may result in administrators not being able to receive any more information from the firewall via ICMP, which includes ping, traceroute, etc. Disabling the ICMPv6 processing on the firewall interface may result in the firewall not being able to communicate on that interface due to a missing neighbor discovery and neighbor advertisement ICMPv6 packets.\r\n\r\nTo disable the ICMP inspection engine, use the no inspect icmp command within the policy-map applied to the service polices.\r\nThe following example shows how to disable the ICMP inspection engine in the policy-map called global_policy:\r\nciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect icmp"

					"details": "IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nFor VPN setup involving LAN-to-LAN tunnel, it is possible to avoid the decryption of an offending ICMP packet by implementing a vpn-filer access-list. The following commands will implement an access-list that blocks any ICMP packets flowing through a VPN tunnel that use the DfltGrpPolicy group-policy in both inbound and outbound direction:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL deny icmp any any\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL permit ip any any      ciscoasa(config)# group-policy DfltGrpPolicy attributes      ciscoasa(config-group-policy)# vpn-filter value DENY_ICMP_ACL\r\n    Note: Because the vulnerability is triggered during the decryption operation, this workaround should be implemented on both devices terminating the VPN tunnel. This workaround is ineffective if applied to only on one side of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nFor Cisco remote IPsec VPN there is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nDisabling Cisco ASA SQL*Net inspection will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the SQL*Net inspection that is configured by default:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\n    ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default      ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect sqlnet\r\n    Digital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nRemote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than disabling the override-account-disable option.\r\n\r\nDigital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nHTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than removing the affected option from the HTTP DPI configuration\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can workaround this issue by ensuring that only UDP traffic is sent to the DNS ALPI engine for inspection.\r\n\r\nTo do that, first create an access-list to match only UDP traffic and then create a class-map to match on that access-list. Note that by default the Cisco ASA Software will only inspect DNS over UDP traffic. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software forwarding only UDP port 53 traffic to the DNS ALPI engine.\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config access-list\r\naccess-list DNS_INSPECT extended permit udp any any eq 53    ciscoasa# show running-config class-map  !  class-map DNS_INSPECT_CP   match access-list DNS_INSPECT  [...]    ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map  !  policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map   parameters    message-length maximum client auto    message-length maximum 512  policy-map global_policy   class inspection_default    inspect ftp    inspect h323 h225    [...]    class DNS_INSPECT_CP    inspect dns preset_dns_map  !\r\n    Note: Inspection of DNS traffic over TCP is currently not supported by the Cisco ASA Software. Implementing this workaround does not create any loss in functionality.\r\n\r\nAnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling AnyConnect SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nSSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling the SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nCrafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can disable the default ICMP policy and ICMP inspection engine to work around this vulnerability.\r\nTo disable the default ICMP policy use the icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the configured interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. To disable the default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 use the ipv6 icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the IPv6 enabled interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. The following example shows how to disable the default ICMP policy and default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 on the outside interface\r\nciscoasa(config)# icmp deny any outside\r\nciscoasa(config)# ipv6 icmp deny any outside\r\n  Note: Disabling the ICMP processing on the firewall interface may result in administrators not being able to receive any more information from the firewall via ICMP, which includes ping, traceroute, etc. Disabling the ICMPv6 processing on the firewall interface may result in the firewall not being able to communicate on that interface due to a missing neighbor discovery and neighbor advertisement ICMPv6 packets.\r\n\r\nTo disable the ICMP inspection engine, use the no inspect icmp command within the policy-map applied to the service polices.\r\nThe following example shows how to disable the ICMP inspection engine in the policy-map called global_policy:\r\nciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect icmp"

The following example shows Cisco ASA Software forwarding only UDP port 53 traffic to the DNS ALPI engine.\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config access-list\r\naccess-list DNS_INSPECT extended permit udp any any eq 53    ciscoasa# show running-config class-map  !  class-map DNS_INSPECT_CP   match access-list DNS_INSPECT  [...]    ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map  !  policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map   parameters    message-length maximum client auto    message-length maximum 512  policy-map global_policy   class inspection_default    inspect ftp    inspect h323 h225    [...]    class DNS_INSPECT_CP    inspect dns preset_dns_map  !\r\n    Note: Inspection of DNS traffic over TCP is currently not supported by the Cisco ASA Software. Implementing this workaround does not create any loss in functionality.\r\n\r\nAnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling AnyConnect SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nSSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling the SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nCrafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can disable the default ICMP policy and ICMP inspection engine to work around this vulnerability.\r\nTo disable the default ICMP policy use the icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the configured interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. To disable the default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 use the ipv6 icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the IPv6 enabled interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. The following example shows how to disable the default ICMP policy and default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 on the outside interface\r\nciscoasa(config)# icmp deny any outside\r\nciscoasa(config)# ipv6 icmp deny any outside\r\n  Note: Disabling the ICMP processing on the firewall interface may result in administrators not being able to receive any more information from the firewall via ICMP, which includes ping, traceroute, etc. Disabling the ICMPv6 processing on the firewall interface may result in the firewall not being able to communicate on that interface due to a missing neighbor discovery and neighbor advertisement ICMPv6 packets.\r\n\r\nTo disable the ICMP inspection engine, use the no inspect icmp command within the policy-map applied to the service polices.\r\nThe following example shows how to disable the ICMP inspection engine in the policy-map called global_policy:\r\nciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect icmp"

					"details": "IPsec VPN Crafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nFor VPN setup involving LAN-to-LAN tunnel, it is possible to avoid the decryption of an offending ICMP packet by implementing a vpn-filer access-list. The following commands will implement an access-list that blocks any ICMP packets flowing through a VPN tunnel that use the DfltGrpPolicy group-policy in both inbound and outbound direction:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL deny icmp any any\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# access-list DENY_ICMP_ACL permit ip any any      ciscoasa(config)# group-policy DfltGrpPolicy attributes      ciscoasa(config-group-policy)# vpn-filter value DENY_ICMP_ACL\r\n    Note: Because the vulnerability is triggered during the decryption operation, this workaround should be implemented on both devices terminating the VPN tunnel. This workaround is ineffective if applied to only on one side of the tunnel.\r\n\r\nFor Cisco remote IPsec VPN there is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSQL*Net Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nDisabling Cisco ASA SQL*Net inspection will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the SQL*Net inspection that is configured by default:\r\n\r\n    ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\n    ciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default      ciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect sqlnet\r\n    Digital Certificate Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nRemote Access VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than disabling the override-account-disable option.\r\n\r\nDigital Certificate HTTP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround that mitigate this vulnerability other than changing the authentication schema for the affected features.\r\n\r\nHTTP Deep Packet Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds other than removing the affected option from the HTTP DPI configuration\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can workaround this issue by ensuring that only UDP traffic is sent to the DNS ALPI engine for inspection.\r\n\r\nTo do that, first create an access-list to match only UDP traffic and then create a class-map to match on that access-list. Note that by default the Cisco ASA Software will only inspect DNS over UDP traffic. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software forwarding only UDP port 53 traffic to the DNS ALPI engine.\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config access-list\r\naccess-list DNS_INSPECT extended permit udp any any eq 53    ciscoasa# show running-config class-map  !  class-map DNS_INSPECT_CP   match access-list DNS_INSPECT  [...]    ciscoasa# show running-config policy-map  !  policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map   parameters    message-length maximum client auto    message-length maximum 512  policy-map global_policy   class inspection_default    inspect ftp    inspect h323 h225    [...]    class DNS_INSPECT_CP    inspect dns preset_dns_map  !\r\n    Note: Inspection of DNS traffic over TCP is currently not supported by the Cisco ASA Software. Implementing this workaround does not create any loss in functionality.\r\n\r\nAnyConnect SSL VPN Memory Exhaustion Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling AnyConnect SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nSSL VPN Web Portal Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround other than disabling the SSL VPN feature.\r\n\r\nCrafted ICMP Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nAdministrators can disable the default ICMP policy and ICMP inspection engine to work around this vulnerability.\r\nTo disable the default ICMP policy use the icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the configured interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. To disable the default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 use the ipv6 icmp deny any <interface_name> command for all the IPv6 enabled interfaces of the Cisco ASA Software. The following example shows how to disable the default ICMP policy and default ICMP policy for ICMPv6 on the outside interface\r\nciscoasa(config)# icmp deny any outside\r\nciscoasa(config)# ipv6 icmp deny any outside\r\n  Note: Disabling the ICMP processing on the firewall interface may result in administrators not being able to receive any more information from the firewall via ICMP, which includes ping, traceroute, etc. Disabling the ICMPv6 processing on the firewall interface may result in the firewall not being able to communicate on that interface due to a missing neighbor discovery and neighbor advertisement ICMPv6 packets.\r\n\r\nTo disable the ICMP inspection engine, use the no inspect icmp command within the policy-map applied to the service polices.\r\nThe following example shows how to disable the ICMP inspection engine in the policy-map called global_policy:\r\nciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default\r\nciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect icmp"
