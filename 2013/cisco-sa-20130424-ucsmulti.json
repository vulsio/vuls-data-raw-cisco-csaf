				"text": "The Cisco Unified Computing System Fabric Interconnect is the switching fabric and management component of an integrated Cisco UCS platform.  Certain vulnerabilities detailed in this section are related to protocols, and while the service is hosted on the Fabric Interconnect the protocols may interact with other components in the Cisco UCS platform such as the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (Cisco IMC) on a Cisco UCS C-Series or B-Series server.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified Computing System LDAP User Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco UCS Manager contains an LDAP authentication bypass vulnerability. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker who can access the Cisco UCS Manager Web Console to authenticate as a specific user without providing valid authentication credentials. To exploit the vulnerability the attacker would need to submit a malformed request to a Cisco UCS Manager login page designed to leverage this vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\nOnly Cisco UCS systems that have been configured for direct LDAP integration are affected and certain LDAP options must be enabled on the LDAP server the Cisco UCS Manager is authenticating against. The vulnerability does not affect other authentication methods such as local, RADIUS, authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA), or TACACS+.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtc91207[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtc91207\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1182.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified Computing System IPMI Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco UCS Manager contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) implementation that is hosted on the Cisco UCS Fabric Interconnect. An unauthenticated, remote attacker who can submit a properly malformed request to the IPMI service via UDP port 623 could trigger a buffer overflow. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability does not require a TCP three-way handshake to exploit because the service runs over UDP.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtd32371[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtd32371\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1183.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified Computing Management API Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\nCisco UCS Manager contains a denial of service vulnerability in the management API. An unauthenticated, remote attacker who can submit a properly malformed request to the XML API management service of the Cisco UCS Manager could cause the service to stop responding. As a result, administrators could not make configuration changes or perform management actions on the Fabric Interconnect and computing resources managed by the device. A restart of the Fabric Interconnect is required to restore functionality.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID CSCtg48206[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtg48206\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1184.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified Computing System Information Disclosure Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco UCS Manager contains an information disclosure vulnerability. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could access technical support or local backup files that were created by a device administrator. The attacker would need to access the web interface of the Cisco UCS Manager to exploit this vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe files that the attacker could access contain sensitive information that could lead to the complete compromise of an affected Cisco UCS platform. The attacker must know the naming convention used by the administrator as well as the date that the files were created. These files are not automatically created on a device, but occur when an administrator creates a tech support bundle file or performs an on-device configuration backup.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID CSCtq86543[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq86543\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1185\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified Computing System KVM Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco UCS platforms contain an IP keyboard, video, mouse (KVM) authentication bypass vulnerability. An unauthenticated, remote attacker who can send a malicious KVM authentication request to the Cisco IMC of a managed computing resource could bypass authentication and access to the IP KVM console of the physical or virtual device. This vulnerability could also allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to join an existing, active IP KVM session if the active owner confirms the request or fails to respond to the request within 60 seconds.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID CSCts53746[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts53746\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-1186.",
