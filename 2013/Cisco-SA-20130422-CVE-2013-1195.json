				"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the time-range object could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass access lists that are using the time-range option.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the code for the time-range object, when the periodic command is used. Due to this issue, the time-range object may have no effect. Therefore, depending on the access-list statement (permit or deny), an attacker could bypass the access list. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers are advised to review the bug reports in the vendor announcements section for a current list of affected versions.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
