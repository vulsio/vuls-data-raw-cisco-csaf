				"text": "A vulnerability in the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) service engine of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker\r\nto create a denial of service (DoS) condition by causing the RIP service engine to\r\nrestart.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper input filtering of\r\nRIP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a\r\nmalformed RIPv4 or RIPv6 message to UDP port 520. A successful exploit\r\ncould result in the target device restarting the RIP service engine, which could lead to a denial of service for any destinations populated in\r\nthe route table by RIP.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security advisory and has released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted requests to the affected software. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that proof-of-concept exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
