An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by flooding the affected service with crafted packets. An exploit could allow the attacker to render some processes nonoperational, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
