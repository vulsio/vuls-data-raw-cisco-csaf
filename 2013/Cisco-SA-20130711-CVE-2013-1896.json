				"text": "A vulnerability in the mod_dav component of the Apache HTTP Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input while handling URI requests. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by transmitting crafted URI requests to the targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nApache has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need access to trusted, internal networks to be able to transmit crafted requests to the targeted system. This access requirement may limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
