An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting Structured Query Language (SQL) commands. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary queries and take full control of the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in CSCub23095[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub23095\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2013-1177.\r\n",
