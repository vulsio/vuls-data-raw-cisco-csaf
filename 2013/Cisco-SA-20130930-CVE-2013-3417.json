An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a crafted URL on a vulnerable Video Surveillance Operations Manager.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, it is likely that an attacker would need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
