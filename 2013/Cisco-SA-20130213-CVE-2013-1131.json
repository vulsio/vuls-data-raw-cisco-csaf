				"text": "Cisco Small Business Wireless Access Points contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of the Service Set Identifier (SSID) when the affected product is performing a \"site survey\" to discover adjacent available networks. An unauthenticated attacker with access to an adjacent network may be able to exploit this vulnerability by broadcasting a crafted SSID and convincing the administrator of the affected device to perform a site survey. A successful attack could cause a DoS condition. Additionally, there is the risk that the attacker could obtain the ability to override part of the memory of the affected device. However, the ability to override memory has not been confirmed.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must have access to an adjacent network and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the administrator to conduct a site survey. This access and user interaction requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
