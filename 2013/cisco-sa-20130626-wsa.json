An\r\nauthenticated, unprivileged attacker could exploit this vulnerability\r\nby sending a crafted URL to the affected system or convince a\r\nvalid user to click on a malicious URL. An successful exploit could allow the\r\nattacker to take complete\r\ncontrol of the affected device.\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities can only be triggered by IPv4 traffic directed to the management IP addresses of the affected system.\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities can be exploited over the default management ports, TCP port 8080 or TCP port 8443. \r\n\r\nNote: The default management ports can be reconfigured on the system. \r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are documented by Cisco bug IDs CSCzv69294[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv69294\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and CSCzv85726[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv85726\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and have been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2013-3383 and CVE-2013-3384.\n\r\n\n\r\nManagement GUI Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) function in the web framework  code could allow an unauthenticated,\r\nremote attacker to cause multiple processes to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to\r\nimproper handling, processing and termination of HTTP and HTTPS connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\r\nsending multiple HTTP or HTTPS requests to any management enabled interfaces of\r\nthe affected system. A full TCP three-way handshake is required to\r\nexploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker prevent management access via the GUI and cause other critical process to become unresponsive, resulting in a denial of service condition. A hard reboot of the affected system is needed to restore full functionality.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability can only be triggered by IPv4 traffic directed to the\r\nmanagement IP addresses of the affected system. This vulnerability can\r\nbe exploited over the default management ports, TCP port 8080 or TCP port 8443. \r\nNote: The default management ports can be reconfigured on the system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID CSCzv58669[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv58669\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3385.\n\r\n",
