				"text": "A vulnerability in the fabric interconnect (FI) web management interface of\r\nthe Cisco Unified Computing System could allow an unauthenticated,\r\nremote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability occurs because the web interface relies on cookies to\r\nauthenticate URL-based commands. An attacker could exploit this\r\nvulnerability by persuading the user to follow a malicious link or visit an\r\nattacker-controlled website while authenticated to the FI web management interface. A successful exploit could allow\r\nthe attacker to perform various activities as the affected user.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
