				"text": "Cisco WAAS application acceleration and WAN optimization solutions accelerate the performance of any TCP-based application delivered across a WAN, providing the benefits of branch-office data consolidation and acceleration of centralized applications.\r\n\r\nEvery WAAS network must have one primary WAAS CM device that is responsible for managing the other WAAS  devices in the network. The Cisco WAAS CM device hosts the Cisco WAAS CM GUI, a web-based interface that allows configuration, management and monitoring of the associated Cisco WAAS devices.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web service framework code of Cisco WAAS, when configured as Central  Manager (CM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute  arbitrary code on the affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due  to insufficient input validation. An attacker could  exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the  affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the  affected system. Due to the privileged function of the WAAS CM  in the Cisco WAAS network, exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the attacker  to gain administrative access to all the devices that have been  associated to the vulnerable WAAS CM.\r\n\r\nNote: Only Cisco WAAS Software configured as CM is affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh26626 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh26626\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3443",
