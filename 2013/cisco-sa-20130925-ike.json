An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKE packets to a device configured with features that leverage IKE version 1 (IKEv1).\n\r\n\n\r\nAlthough IKEv1 is automatically enabled on a Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software when IKEv1 or IKE version 2 (IKEv2) is configured, the vulnerability can be triggered only by sending a malformed IKEv1 packet.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn specific conditions, normal IKEv1 packets can also cause an affected release of Cisco IOS Software to leak memory.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly IKEv1 is affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nAn exploit could cause Cisco IOS Software not to release allocated memory, causing a memory leak. A sustained attack may result in a device reload.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability. \n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130925-ike[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130925-ike\"]\n\r\nNote: The September 25, 2013, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes eight Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the September 2013 bundled publication. \r\n\r\nIndividual publication links are in \"Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication\" at the following link: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep13.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep13.html\"]\r\n\n",

				"text": "Although only IKEv1 packets can be used to trigger this vulnerability, devices that are running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software are vulnerable when they are configured to use IKEv1 or IKEv2.\n\r\n\n\r\nConfiguring IKEv2 on Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software automatically enables IKEv1.\n\r\n\n\r\nA number of features use IKEv1, including different types of VPNs such as the following:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    LAN-to-LAN VPN \r\n    Remote access VPN (excluding SSLVPN) \r\n    Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) \r\n    Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) \r\n\r\n\n\r\nThe preferred method to determine whether a device has been configured for IKE is to issue the show ip sockets or show udp EXEC command. If the device has UDP port 500, UDP port 4500, or UDP port 848 open, it is processing IKE packets.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the following example, the device is processing IKE packets in UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500, using either IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6):\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrouter# show udp \nProto        Remote      Port      Local       Port  In Out  Stat TTY OutputIF  \n17       --listen--          192.168.130.21    500   0   0 1001011   0   \n17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN           500   0   0 1020011   0   \n17       --listen--          192.168.130.21   4500   0   0 1001011   0   \n17(v6)   --listen--          UNKNOWN          4500   0   0 1020011   0  \n!--- Output truncated \nrouter#\n\n\r\n\r\nTo determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\" or \"Cisco IOS Software.\" The image name displays in parentheses, followed by \"Version\" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\nRouter> show version \nCisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\nCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\nCompiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team\r\n!--- output truncated \r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in \"White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide\" at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"]. \r\n\r\n",

				"text": "The IKE protocol is used in the IP Security (IPsec) protocol suite to negotiate cryptographic attributes that will be used to encrypt or authenticate the communication session. These attributes include cryptographic algorithm, mode, and shared keys. The result of IKE is a shared session secret that will be used to derive cryptographic keys.\n\r\n\n\r\n Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software support IKE for IPv4 and IPv6 communications.  IKE communication can use any of the following UDP ports:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    UDP port 500 \r\n    UDP port 4500, Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal (NAT-T) \r\n    UDP port 848,  Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) \r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that could lead to a device reload.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed IKE packets by the affected software.

				"text": "There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following identification mechanism exists for this vulnerability.\n\r\nEmbedded Event Manager (EEM)\r\nA Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect a memory leak that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the memory for the affected process on a Cisco IOS device. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade or reload the device to recover the lost memory at a suitable time. The example policy is based on a Tcl script that sends a syslog message when the memory keeps dropping and reaches EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES and when the IKE buffers have dropped EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES times. If IKE buffers are freed the counter starts counting from zero. After generating the memory leak syslog message the script re-initializes. \n\r\nThe Tcl script is available for download in Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community[\"https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-30300\"].\n\r\n\n\r\n A sample device configuration follows:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nevent manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_INTERVAL 20\nevent manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_MAX_RUNTIME 5\nevent manager environment EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES 3\nevent manager environment EEM_FREE_MEMORY_THRES 70\nevent manager directory user policy \"flash:/\"\nevent manager policy eem_ike_mem_leak.tcl\r\n\n",

The policy allows administrators to monitor the memory for the affected process on a Cisco IOS device. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade or reload the device to recover the lost memory at a suitable time. The example policy is based on a Tcl script that sends a syslog message when the memory keeps dropping and reaches EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES and when the IKE buffers have dropped EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES times. If IKE buffers are freed the counter starts counting from zero. After generating the memory leak syslog message the script re-initializes. \n\r\nThe Tcl script is available for download in Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community[\"https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-30300\"].\n\r\n\n\r\n A sample device configuration follows:\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nevent manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_INTERVAL 20\nevent manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_MAX_RUNTIME 5\nevent manager environment EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES 3\nevent manager environment EEM_FREE_MEMORY_THRES 70\nevent manager directory user policy \"flash:/\"\nevent manager policy eem_ike_mem_leak.tcl\r\n\n"
