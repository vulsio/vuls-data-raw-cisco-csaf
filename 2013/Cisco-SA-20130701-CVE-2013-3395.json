The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. \n\r\n\n\r\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the affected web browser with the privileges of the user.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link to a malicious site and may persuade the user to follow the link by using misleading language and instructions.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
