An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing a crafted HTTP request to a WebEx node and read files from the cache directory.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would likely need access to a trusted, internal network to send crafted HTTP requests to the targeted system. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful attack.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers are advised to review the bug reports in the \"Vendor Announcements\" section for a current list of affected versions.\n\r\n\n\r\nSoftware updates are available for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server; however, at the time this alert was first published, software updates for Cisco WebEx Node for MCS were not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdministrators are advised to contact the vendor regarding future updates and releases.",
