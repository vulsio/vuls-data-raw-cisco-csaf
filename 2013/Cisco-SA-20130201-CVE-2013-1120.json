				"text": "Cisco Unity Express contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input processed by the Cisco Unity Express software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to follow a malicious link that is designed to submit malicious requests to the affected software. If successful, the attacker could perform certain unauthorized actions on the vulnerable software, which could be used to conduct further attacks on the system.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerabilities in a security notice; however software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\n\r\n\n\r\nAll affected versions of the software have reached End of Software Maintenance or Last Day of Support.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unity Express software prior to version 8.0 is supported only on NM-CUE, NM-CUE-EC, AIM-CUE, AIM2-CUE-K9, and NME-CUE hardware modules. Hardware modules NM-CUE and NM-CUE-EC reached the Last Day of Support on April 15, 2011. Hardware module AIM-CUE reached the End of Software Maintenance on September 27, 2011. Hardware modules AIM2-CUE-K9 and NME-CUE reached the End of Software Maintenance on December 1, 2012.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco would like to thank security researcher Jacob Holcomb for reporting these vulnerabilities.",
