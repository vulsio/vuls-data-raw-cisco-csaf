				"text": "Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) and Advanced Recording Format (ARF) Players. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to crash an affected player, and in some cases, could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system of a targeted user.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on the computer of an on-line meeting attendee. The players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx server.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has updated affected versions of the Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites, Cisco WebEx 11 meeting sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings Server, and Cisco WebEx WRF and ARF Players to address these vulnerabilities.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. This advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130904-webex[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130904-webex\"]",

The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27 and WBS28), Cisco WebEx 11, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server are affected by at least one of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\n\r\n\r\n    Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS28) client builds prior to T28.8 (28.8)\r\n    Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27) client builds prior to T27LDSP32EP16 (27.32.16)\r\n    Cisco WebEx 11 versions prior to 1.2 SP6 (1.2.6.0) with client builds prior to T28.8 (28.8)\r\n    Cisco WebEx Meetings Server client builds prior to T27L10NSP32_ORION111\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support > Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under \"About Support Center.\" See \"Software Versions and Fixes\" for details.\n\r\n\n\r\nAlternatively, version information of the Cisco WebEx Meeting client can be accessed from within the Cisco WebEx Meeting client. To determine version information of the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Windows and Linux platforms, it can be viewed by choosing Help > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center to determine version information of the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Mac platforms, it can be viewed by choosing Meeting Center > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.16 is fixed, build 27.32.17 will contain updated software; Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, for example, T27 SP32 EP16. The example shows the server is running client build 27.32.16.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.",

				"text": "When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27 and WBS28) and Cisco WebEx 11 correct the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\r\n\r\n    Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS28) client builds T28.8 (28.8) or later\r\n    Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27) client builds 27.32.16 (T27LDSP32EP16) or later\r\n    Cisco WebEx 11 1.2.6.0 (1.2 SP6) builds T28.8 (28.8) or later\r\n\r\nClient builds of the Cisco WebEx Business Suite prior to T27 SP32 have reached end of support; to obtain fixed software please upgrade to the latest version.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following client builds of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server correct the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\r\n\r\n    Cisco WebEx Meetings Server client builds T27L10NSP32_ORION111 or later\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support > Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under \"About Support Center.\" See \"Software Versions and Fixes\" for details. The Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.16 is fixed, build 27.32.17 will contain updated software.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx WRF and ARF players. The Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the players are all affected by at least one vulnerability described in this advisory. If the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html[\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nUsers can manually verify the installed version of the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player to determine whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities. To do so, an administrator must examine the version numbers of the installed files and determine whether the version of the file contains the fixed code. Detailed instructions on how to verify the version numbers are provided in the following sections.\n\r\n\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows\n\r\n\n\r\nFive dynamic link libraries (DLLs) were updated on the Microsoft Windows platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. These files are in the C:\\Program Files\\WebEx\\Record Playback folder or the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Webex\\Record Player folder. The version number of a DLL can be obtained by browsing the Record Playback directory in Windows Explorer, right-clicking the filename, and choosing Properties. The Version or Details tab of the Properties page provides details on the library version. The following table provides the first fixed version for each DLL. If the installed versions are equal to or greater than the versions provided in the table, the system is not vulnerable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Product\r\n            Client Build\r\n            Cisco DLL Filename\r\n            DLL File Versions\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS27\r\n            27.32.16\r\n            Atas32_Lite.dll\n\r\n            \r\n            1027,1232,1016,2201\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS27\r\n            27.32.16\r\n            atpdmod.dll\n\r\n            \r\n            2029.1232.1116.2300\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS27\r\n            27.32.16\r\n            atas32.dll\r\n            1027,1232,1016,2200\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS27\r\n            27.32.16\r\n            atjpg60.dll\n\r\n            \r\n            1027,1232,1016,2200\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS27\r\n            27.32.16\r\n            atdl2006.dll\r\n            1027,1232,1016,2200\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS27\r\n            27.32.16\r\n            atprtsc.dll\n\r\n            \r\n            2029.1232.1116.2300\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS27\r\n            27.32.16\r\n            atprtses.dll\n\r\n            \r\n            2029.1232.1116.2300\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS27\r\n            27.32.16\r\n            nbrpd.dll\r\n            2029.1232.1116.2300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS28\r\n            28.8\r\n            atas32_lite.dll\r\n            28,0800,0112,1105\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS28\r\n            28.8\r\n            atas32.dll\r\n            28,0800,0012,1105\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS28\r\n            28.8\r\n            atdl2006.dll\r\n            1028,1208,1100,0500\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS28\r\n            28.8\r\n            atjpg60.dll\r\n            2028,1208,1100,500\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS28\r\n            28.8\r\n            atpdmod.dll\r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS28\r\n            28.8\r\n            atprtsc.dll\r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS28\r\n            28.8\r\n            atprtses.dll\r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WBS28\r\n            28.8\r\n            nbrpd.dll\r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx 11\r\n            28.8\r\n            atas32_lite.dll\r\n            28,0800,0012,1105\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx 11\r\n            28.8\r\n            atas32.dll\r\n            28,0800,0012,1105\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx 11\r\n            28.8\r\n            atdl2006.dll\r\n            1028,1208,1100,0500\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx 11\r\n            28.8\r\n            atjpg60.dll\r\n            2028,1208,1100,500\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx 11\r\n            28.8 \r\n            atpdmod.dll\r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx 11\r\n            28.8\r\n            atprtsc.dll\r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx 11\r\n            28.8\r\n            atprtses.dll\r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx 11\r\n            28.8\r\n            nbrpd.dll\r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx Meetings Server\r\n            T27L10NSP32_ORION111\r\n            atpdmod.dll\r\n            2029.1332.400.1703\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx Meetings Server\r\n            T27L10NSP32_ORION111\r\n            nbrpd.dll\r\n            2029.1332.400.1703\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx Meetings Server\r\n            T27L10NSP32_ORION111\r\n            pdcvt.dll\r\n            2029.1332.400.1703\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx Meetings Server\r\n            T27L10NSP32_ORION111\r\n            atprtses.dll\r\n            2029.1332.400.1703\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx Meetings Server\r\n            T27L10NSP32_ORION111\r\n            atprtsc.dll\r\n            2029.1332.400.1703\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\n\r\nApple Mac OS X\n\r\n\n\r\nFour package bundles were updated on the Apple Mac OS platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
