				"text": "A vulnerability in input parsing in Cisco NX-OS Software could\r\nallow an authenticated, local attacker to execute commands on the\r\nunderlying operating system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper\r\nfiltering of parameters passed to the Stream Editor (sed) filter. An attacker could\r\nexploit this vulnerability by using sed with the e option. A\r\nsuccessful exploit could allow the attacker to access the bash shell and run arbitrary shell\r\ncommands with administrative privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and has released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires authenticated access to the targeted system. Authenticated access may require the attacker to access trusted, internal networks. These requirements could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
