Cisco Unified Communications Manager contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute code remotely.\n\r\n\n\r\nDenial of Service Vulnerabilities\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified\r\nCommunications Manager 7.1(x) contains a vulnerability that could allow\r\nan unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition on an\r\naffected device. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling . An attacker could\r\nexploit this vulnerability by sending malformed registration messages, resulting in a DoS condition on an\r\naffected device. This vulnerability is documented in\r\nCisco bug ID CSCuf93466[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf93466\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"]\r\ncustomers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities\r\nand Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3459.  This vulnerability affects\r\nonly Cisco UCM versions 7.1(x).\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified\r\nCommunications Manager 8.5(x), 8.6(x), and 9.0(x) contain a vulnerability that\r\ncould allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient limiting of traffic on certain\r\nUDP ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending UDP\r\npackets at a high rate to certain ports on an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition on the\r\naffected device. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub85597[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub85597\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-3460. \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified\r\nCommunications Manager versions 8.5(x), 8.6(x) and 9.0(1) contain a\r\nvulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to\r\ncause a DoS condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient rate limiting of traffic on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) port. An attacker could exploit this\r\nvulnerability by sending UDP packets at a high rate to port 5060 on an\r\naffected device. A sustained attack could allow the attacker to cause a\r\nDoS condition on the affected device. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub35869[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub35869\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures CVE ID CVE-2013-3461. \n\r\n\n\r\nBuffer Overflow Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco\r\nUnified Communications Manager 7.1(x), 8.5(x), 8.6(x), 9.0(x) and 9.1(x) contain a vulnerability that could\r\nallow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow on\r\nan affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checking. An attacker\r\ncould exploit this vulnerability by overwriting an allocated memory\r\nbuffer on an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to\r\ncorrupt data, disrupt services, or run arbitrary commands. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud54358[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud54358\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2013-3462.  This vulnerability affects Cisco UCM versions 7.1(x) through 9.1(1x).",
