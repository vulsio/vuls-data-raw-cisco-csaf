				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Nexus 1000V could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) to report a Virtual Ethernet Module (VEM) as unavailable.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient prioritization for VSM/VEM heartbeat messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by preventing the successful delivery of heartbeat messages between a VSM and a VEM with a UDP flood, causing the VSM to report the affected VEMs as unavailable.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco would like to thank Felix 'FX' Lindner, Recurity Labs GmbH, for reporting this issue to us.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would likely need access to a trusted, internal network in which the targeted device may reside. This access restriction limits the possibility of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers are advised to review the bug reports in the \"Vendor Announcements\" section for a current list of affected versions.",
