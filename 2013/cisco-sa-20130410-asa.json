				"text": "IKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA device running Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if IKE version 1 is enabled. IKE version 1 is enabled if the command crypto isakmp enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.3.x and earlier) or crypto ikev1 enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.4.x and later) is configured.\n\r\n\n\r\nIKE version 1 is not enabled by default.\n\r\nCrafted URL Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA device running Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the device is using authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users are enabled. HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users are enabled if the command aaa authentication listener is configured.\n\r\n\n\r\nAAA for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users are not enabled by default.\n\r\nDenial of Service During Validation of Crafted Certificates\r\nTo be vulnerable, Cisco ASA Software must have at least one authenticated trustpoint enrolled with a third-party certificate authority or enrolled with the Cisco ASA local certificate authority. \r\n\r\nTo determine whether Cisco ASA Software is configured with an authenticated trustpoint, use the show crypto ca certificate command and verify that the certificate is associated to at least one trustpoint. The following example shows a certificate associated to a trustpoint called 'test' \r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show crypto ca certificates\n[...]\n  Status: Available\n  [...]\n  Associated Trustpoints: test\r\n\r\nDigital certificate authentication is not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if DNS inspection is enabled. \r\n\r\nTo determine whether DNS inspection is enabled, use the show service-policy | include dns command. The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with DNS inspection enabled: \r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show service-policy | include dns\n    Inspect: dns preset_dns_map, packet 0, lock fail 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0 \r\nDNS inspection is enabled by default.\n\r\nDetermining the Running Software Version\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the show version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco ASA Software version 8.4(1):\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa#show version | include Version\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) \nDevice Manager Version 6.4(1)\n\r\nCustomers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to manage devices can locate the software version in the table that is displayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM window.\r\n",

				"text": "Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is the operating system used by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, the Cisco ASA Services Module (ASASM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, and the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall. The Cisco ASA family provides network security services such as firewall, intrusion prevention system (IPS), anti-X, and VPN.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software contains multiple vulnerabilities that may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.\n\r\nIKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nThe IKE version 1 implementation contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of an incoming IKE version 1 message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IKE message.  An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects routed firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) traffic.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub85692[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub85692\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1149.\n\r\nCrafted URL Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the URL processing code of the authentication proxy feature of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to mishandling of a crafted URL. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted URL to an affected device.  An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service condition.\n\r\nBoth transit traffic and traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. \r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud16590[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud16590\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1150.\n\r\nDenial of Service During Validation of Crafted Certificates\r\nA vulnerability in the implementation of the function used to validate digital certificates for authentication could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an implementation error in the code that validates the digital certificates used during authentication.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted certificate to trigger an authentication operation on an affected device.\n\r\nOnly traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc72408[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc72408\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1151.\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nCisco ASA Software DNS application inspection supports DNS message controls that provide protection against DNS spoofing and cache poisoning.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the DNS inspection engine code of Cisco ASA Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of the affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper processing of some fields in DNS messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS message that triggers inspection by an affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly transit traffic can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc80080[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc80080\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1152\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "\n\r\nIKE Version 1 Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nDisabling IKE version 1, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. Note that disabling IKE version 1 will disable IPsec-based VPN tunnels (LAN-to-LAN and remote access) that are configured to use IKE version 1 for Security Association (SA) negotiation and establishment. However, if administrators use only SSL VPN (remote access only), it may be possible to disable IKE version 1 with no impact to the VPN solution. IKE version 1 can be disabled with the global configuration commands  no crypto isakmp enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.3.x and earlier) or no crypto ikev1 enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.4.x and later).\r\n\r\nIKE version 2 is not affected by this vulnerability, so migrating to IKE version 2 and disabling IKE version 1 will eliminate this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCrafted URL Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nDisabling AAA for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users can be disabled with the global configuration command no aaa authentication listener.\r\n\r\nDenial of Service During Validation of Crafted Certificates\r\nThere are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nDisabling DNS inspection, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the DNS inspection that is configured by default: \r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\nciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default\nciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect dns\r\n",

Note that disabling IKE version 1 will disable IPsec-based VPN tunnels (LAN-to-LAN and remote access) that are configured to use IKE version 1 for Security Association (SA) negotiation and establishment. However, if administrators use only SSL VPN (remote access only), it may be possible to disable IKE version 1 with no impact to the VPN solution. IKE version 1 can be disabled with the global configuration commands  no crypto isakmp enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.3.x and earlier) or no crypto ikev1 enable  (Cisco ASA Software 8.4.x and later).\r\n\r\nIKE version 2 is not affected by this vulnerability, so migrating to IKE version 2 and disabling IKE version 1 will eliminate this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCrafted URL Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nDisabling AAA for network access control and HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. HTTP(S) listening ports to authenticate network users can be disabled with the global configuration command no aaa authentication listener.\r\n\r\nDenial of Service During Validation of Crafted Certificates\r\nThere are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDNS Inspection Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nDisabling DNS inspection, if feasible, will mitigate this vulnerability. The following commands will disable the DNS inspection that is configured by default: \r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policy\nciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_default\nciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect dns\r\n"

Note that disabling IKE version 1 will disable IPsec-based VPN tunnels (LAN-to-LAN and remote access) that are configured to use IKE version 1 for Security Association (SA) negotiation and establishment. However, if administrators use only SSL VPN (remote access only), it may be possible to disable IKE version 1 with no impact to the VPN solution.
