An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by capturing the GET request of a SocialMiner gadget. An exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information of the user authenticated to the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the position to capture a GET request of a SocialMiner agent. Typically, these systems would reside on trusted, internal networks, in which an attacker would likely need access. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
