				"text": "Cisco devices running affected Cisco IOS Software versions configured with T1/E1 interface module signaling are vulnerable.\r\nA device is vulnerable if all the following criteria are met:\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interface controller configured for T1/E1 channel group is using the affected High-Level Data Link Control 32 (HDLC32) driver.\r\nT1/E1 controller clock source is configured for line or internal\r\nNote: The affected HDLC32 driver is only used on VWIC2 interface cards for Cisco 1900, 2900 and 3900 Series Integrated Services Routers (ISR).\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco IOS device is configured with T1/E1 signaling on a controller using HDLC32 driver, issue the show controllers command.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the interface Serial0/0/0, configured for T1 signaling is using an HDLC32 driver as indicated by the “Hardware is HDLC32” output:\r\nRouter#show controllers Serial0/0/0:0\r\nInterface Serial0/0/0:0\r\nHardware is HDLC32\r\n< output truncated >\r\n\r\n  Note: The vulnerability in the HDLC32 device driver on VWIC2 interface cards is not specific to Cisco High-Level Data Link Control network protocol encapsulation. Any supported encapsulation type on VWIC2 interface cards will result in the vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo determine a clock source type configured on a T1/E1 interface on a Cisco IOS device, issue the show controllers T1/E1 command.\r\nThe following example shows an E1 interface on a Cisco IOS device configured with line clock source:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show controllers e1\r\nE1 0 is up.\r\n  Applique type is Channelized E1 - balanced\r\n!--- output truncated\r\nFraming is CRC4, Line Code is HDB3, Clock Source is Line Primary.\r\n!--- output truncated\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\" or \"Cisco IOS Software.\" The image name displays in parentheses, followed by \"Version\" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\nCisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team\r\n!--- output truncated\r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in \"White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide\" at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"].",

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending bursty traffic through the affected interface driver. Repeated exploitation could cause a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nA device is vulnerable if it is configured with T1/E1 signaling on an interface that is using an HDLC32 driver.\r\n\r\nAn attacker with some knowledge of the affected infrastructure could exploit this vulnerability by sending a bursty profile of network packets through vulnerable devices. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to wedge the transmit queue of an egress interface.\r\n\r\n  Workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability are available.\r\n\r\nValid network traffic could trigger this vulnerability on devices that are considered vulnerable. An attacker could send an bursty profile of network packets egressing an interface with set conditions to exploit this vulnerability. Recovery from this interface queue wedge requires a reload of the device.\r\n\r\nAn interface queue wedge is a class of vulnerability where certain packets are received and queued by a Cisco IOS router or switch but, due to a processing error, are never removed from the queue.\r\n\r\nFor more information about queue wedges and a few detection mechanisms that may be used to identify a blocked interface on Cisco IOS Software (including a white paper describing how this condition can be detected using SNMP) see http://blogs.cisco.com/security/comments/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub67465 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub67465\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5477.",

				"text": "If a hardware upgrade is an option, a possible workaround would be to use VWIC3-T1/E1 or HWIC-T1/E1 interface cards instead of the VWIC2 interface card.\r\nAlternatively, if the T1/E1 controller is configured for clock source line, and only a single channel-group is configured under controller, a possible workaround is to configure clock source line independent.\r\n  The following identification mechanism exist for this vulnerability.\r\n  Embedded Event Manager (EEM)\r\n\r\n\r\nA Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect an interface queue wedge that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the interfaces for Cisco IOS devices and detect when the interface input queues are full. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade, implement suitable mitigations or reload the device to clear the input queue.\r\n\r\nThe Tcl script is available for download at the \"Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community\" at the following link: https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337 [\"https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337\"]\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Security blog \"Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained\" can be viewed at the following link: http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/ [\"http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/\"]",

The policy allows administrators to monitor the interfaces for Cisco IOS devices and detect when the interface input queues are full. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade, implement suitable mitigations or reload the device to clear the input queue.\r\n\r\nThe Tcl script is available for download at the \"Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community\" at the following link: https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337 [\"https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337\"]\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Security blog \"Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained\" can be viewed at the following link: http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/ [\"http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/\"]"
