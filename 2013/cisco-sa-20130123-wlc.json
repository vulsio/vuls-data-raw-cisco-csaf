				"text": "The Cisco WLCs and Cisco WiSMs are responsible for system-wide wireless LAN functionality, including security policies, intrusion prevention, RF management, quality of service (QoS), and mobility. These devices communicate with controller-based access points over any Layer 2 (Ethernet) or Layer 3 (IP) infrastructure using the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP) and the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco WLC family of devices is affected by the following vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Wireless LAN Controllers Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (wIPS) Denial of Service Vulnerability \r\n\r\nThe Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload by sending crafted IP packets to the affected device. This vulnerability affects Cisco WLCs that are configured with Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (wIPS). This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtx80743[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtx80743\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1102.\r\n\r\nCisco Wireless LAN Controllers Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists on the Cisco Wireless Access Points (AP) that are managed by Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) which could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the AP to reload by sending crafted Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) packets to the affected device. This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be triggered by transit traffic and even if SIP features are disabled on the device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCts87659[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts87659\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1103.\n\r\nCisco Wireless LAN Controllers HTTP Profiling Remote Code Execution Vulnerability \r\nThe HTTP Profiling feature of Cisco WLC devices is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability that may allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device by sending a crafted UserAgent string. This vulnerability can be exploited from both wired and wireless segments.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly Cisco WLC Software version 7.3.101.0 is affected by this vulnerability. A device is vulnerable only if the HTTP Profiling feature is enabled.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine if the HTTP Profiling feature is enabled, issue the show wlan command and locate the \"HTTP\" option under the \"Network Admission Control\"' section.  The following example shows the feature enabled:\n\r\n\n\r\n(WLC)>show wlan 3\nWLAN Identifier.................................. 3\n\nNetwork Admission Control\n  Client Profiling Status ....................... Enabled\n   DHCP ......................................... Disabled\n   HTTP ......................................... Enabled\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc15636[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc15636\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1104.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Wireless LAN Controllers SNMP Unauthorized Access Vulnerability\r\nThe Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) product family is affected by an unauthorized access vulnerability where an authenticated attacker could view and modify the configuration of an affected Cisco WLC via SNMP even if \"management over wireless\" feature is disabled.\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCua60653[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua60653\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)  and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1105.\n\r\n\n",
