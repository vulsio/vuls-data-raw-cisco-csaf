An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests consisting of Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe impact of this vulnerability on Cisco products varies\r\ndepending on the affected product.

There is no\r\nauthentication needed to execute the attack on Cisco ISE, Cisco\r\nUnified SIP Proxy and Cisco Unified CCE or Cisco PCCE.
