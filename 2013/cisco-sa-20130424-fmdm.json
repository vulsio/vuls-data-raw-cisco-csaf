This vulnerability affects Cisco Device Manager for the Cisco MDS 9000 Family and Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches when it is installed or launched via the Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) on a host running Microsoft Windows. \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Device Manager installed or launched from Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) or Cisco Fabric Manager is not affected. This vulnerability can only be exploited if the JNLP file is executed on systems running Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability affects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the client host performing the installation or execution of Cisco Device Manager via JNLP file. There is no impact on the Cisco MDS 9000 Family or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability in the Cisco Device Manager for Cisco MDS 9000 Family Switches. Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches have discontinued the support of the Cisco Device Manager installation via JNLP and updates are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\nWorkarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available.\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130424-fmdm[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130424-fmdm\"]",

				"text": "Cisco Device Manager can be used for detailed switch provisioning and provides a graphical representation of the Cisco MDS 9000 Family or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches chassis.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Device Manager could be installed either from the Cisco Prime Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) previously called Cisco Fabric Manager server, or via JNLP file downloaded from the switch web interface. \n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in theÂ Java Archive (JAR) executable files that are downloaded via JNLP from the Cisco MDS 9000 Series or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the client host that is executing the JNLP file. Command execution would occur with the privileges of the user.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of certain parameters passed by the element-manager.jnlp file and executed by the affected JAR files. An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by redirecting the user to download a crafted version of the element-manager.jnlp file and execute the file.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability affects Cisco Device Manager installed or launched via the JNLP method. Cisco Device Manager installed or launched from Cisco Prime DCNM or Cisco Fabric Manager is not affected. This vulnerability can only be exploited if the JNLP file is executed on systems running Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability affects the\r\nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of the client host\r\nperforming the installation of Cisco Device Manager. There is no impact\r\non the Cisco MDS 9000 Family or Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCty17417[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty17417\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco MDS 9000 Family Switches and CSCty10802[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty10802\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco Nexus 5000 Series Switches.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1192.",
