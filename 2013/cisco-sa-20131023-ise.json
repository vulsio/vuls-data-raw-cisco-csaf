An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands and execute the affected function. An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the affected system with the privilege of the root user.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability can be exploited over the default management TCP port 443. A full three-way handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh81511 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh81511\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5530.\r\n\r\nCisco ISE Support Information Download Authentication Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the implementation of the authentication code that is used to validate requests to download a product support bundle could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download a full product support bundle.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an error in the logic that is used to validate support bundle access requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable system. An exploit could allow an attacker to obtain a full copy of the product configuration or other sensitive information including administrative credentials.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability can be exploited over the default  management port TCP port 443.
