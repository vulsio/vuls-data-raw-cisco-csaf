				"text": "Cisco Prime Central for HCS Assurance, formerly known as Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation (HCM), is a service that allows Cisco partners to provide a wide range of Cisco collaboration applications to their customers as a subscriber-based solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Prime Central for HCS Assurance contains multiple  vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send a TCP connection flood to disrupt services and cause a DoS condition on the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nMemory Leak Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Prime Central for HCS Assurance contains a memory leak vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker  to execute a sustained flood against vulnerable TCP ports to cause a DoS condition on the affected system.  This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub59158[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub59158\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3390.A system restart is required to clear the condition. Cisco  Hosted Collaboration Mediation Service Assurance 9.1 and earlier are affected.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nMemory Exhaustion Vulnerabilities\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nCisco Prime Central for HCS Assurance contains two memory exhaustion vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker  to execute a sustained TCP connection flood against an affected system. A sustained TCP connection flood against the affected ports will result in memory exhaustion, preventing access to the web GUI  and cause out-of-memory exceptions when executing basic commands.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe first vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtz90114[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz90114\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3389. TCP ports 61615 and 61616 are affected by this vulnerability. Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Service Assurance 9.1 and earlier is affected.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe second vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtz92776[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz92776\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3388. The Ephemeral Java Port (44444) is affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Service Assurance 9.1 and earlier are affected.\n\r\n\n\r\nDisk Exhaustion Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Prime Central for HCS Assurance contains a disk exhaustion vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected system. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCua42724[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua42724\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-3387.  A TCP connection flood will generate error logs until the server disk space is exhausted.  The log files must be removed to recover from this condition. The Omnibus Port (TCP 5400) is affected by this vulnerability. Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Service Assurance 9.1 and earlier are affected.\n",
