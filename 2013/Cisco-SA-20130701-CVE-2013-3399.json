An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by overflowing a buffer. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo successfully exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need to authenticate and have local access to the targeted system, which could limit the likelihood of an exploit.",
