An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting multiple registration requests and viewing the resulting error messages to determine which email addresses have been submitted by other registered attendees.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, it is likely that an attacker would need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside, to submit registration request and also view the error messages. This access requirement reduces the possibility of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
