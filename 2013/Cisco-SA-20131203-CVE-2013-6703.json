				"text": "A vulnerability in the TLS/SSLv3 module of the Cisco ONS 15454 Controller Cards could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the control card to reset.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of the TLS/SSLv3 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific set of packets to the control card. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger the control card to reset.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker likely would need access to trusted, internal networks to send TLS/SSLv3 packets to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the possibility of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
