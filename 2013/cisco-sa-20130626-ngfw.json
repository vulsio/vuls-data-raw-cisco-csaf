				"text": "\n\r\nThe Cisco ASA NGFW is an add-on services module that extends the Cisco ASA platform by delivering application and user ID awareness capabilities for enhanced visibility and control of network traffic.\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in fragmented traffic processing on Cisco ASA NGFW could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to invalid parsing of reassembled packet data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented traffic to be processed by one of the ASA NGFW deny policies.\n\r\n\n\r\nUnder specific conditions, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented IPv4 or IPv6 packets through the Cisco ASA NGFW. To exploit this vulnerability, an affected Cisco ASA NGFW must have a configured policy that denies user traffic. Processing fragmented packets against a deny policy, could cause the Cisco ASA NGFW to reload.\n\r\nAdditionally, if the Cisco ASA, with a Cisco ASA NGFW module running an affected version of software is configured in High-Availability mode (HA), a failover event may be triggered when the Cisco ASA NGFW reloads or stops forwarding traffic.\n\r\n\n\r\nOnly user traffic specifically directed towards the Cisco ASA NGFW by the Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the parent Cisco ASA is affected by the vulnerability in this advisory.��\n\r\nManagement traffic to or from Cisco ASA NGFW is not affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID��CSCue88387[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue88387\"] (registered[\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)��for��Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall Services and��has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-3382.\n",

				"text": "\r\nIf the vulnerability has been exploited on the Cisco ASA NGFW and the traffic is interrupted, as a mitigation, the Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the Cisco ASA that is used to direct the user traffic toward the Cisco ASA NGFW can be removed. This will cause all user traffic to bypass Cisco ASA NGFW module inspection and allow it to pass through the Cisco ASA without inspection provided by the ASA NGFW.\r\n\n\r\n\r\nThe following example shows how to disable the redirecting of web traffic to the Cisco ASA NGFW module from the Cisco ASA firewall:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASA(config)# policy-map cx_traffic_policy\n\r\nASA(config-pmap)# class cx_traffic\n\r\nASA(config-pmap-c)# no cxcs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nNote:��Cisco ASA can be configured with fail-open under MPF configuration. The fail-open keyword sets the Cisco ASA to allow all traffic through, uninspected, if the Cisco ASA NGFW module is unavailable.\n\r\n\n\r\nAlternatively, fragmented traffic can be disallowed on the Cisco ASA firewall. This will cause the Cisco ASA firewall not to accept any fragments on its interfaces. Consequently, the Cisco ASA will not send any fragments to the Cisco ASA NGFW software module for inspection.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows how to disable processing of fragmented traffic on the Cisco ASA firewall:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASA(config)# fragment chain 1��\r\n\r\nNote:��The above example will disable fragments on all the Cisco ASA interfaces. Fragmented traffic directed to and through the Cisco ASA will be dropped. Consequently, the Cisco ASA will not forward any fragmented traffic to the Cisco ASA NGFW or any of the configured modules.\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n",
