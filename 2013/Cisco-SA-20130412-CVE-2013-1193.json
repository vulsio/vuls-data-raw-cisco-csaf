				"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) function could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to deny SSH management access to legitimate users.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the logic to terminate SSH sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by starting an SSH session to the affected system. This vulnerability affects both SSHv1 and v2. An exploit could allow the attacker to deny SSH management access to legitimate users. The attacker can deny the access for 60 seconds, and then the affected system will release the resource and users will be able to use the SSH service again. However, repeated exploitation may lead to a denial of service condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAn attacker can only deny access to a targeted system for 60 seconds, which then the affected system will release the resource to allow legitimate users SSH access again. However, repeated exploitation could lead to a sustained DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers are advised to review the bug report in the vendor announcements section for a current list of affected versions.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
