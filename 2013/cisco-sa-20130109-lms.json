Cisco Prime LMS software is supported over Windows and Solaris or distributed in Virtual Appliance mode (also known as soft appliance mode).\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Prime LMS Virtual Appliance is a bundle of a Linux-based operating system (OS) and the LMS application that is preinstalled. This software is distributed in a single Open Virtual Archive (OVA) file that can be instantiated directly on a supported VMware virtualization environment.\n\r\n\n\r\nLinux-based Cisco Prime LAN Management Solution (LMS) Virtual Appliance contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privilege of the root user. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of authentication and authorization commands by the remote shell server (rshd) running on the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the remote shell (rsh) service of the affected system and sending arbitrary commands.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Only Linux-based Cisco Prime LMS Virtual Appliances are affected by this vulnerability. Cisco Prime LMS running on Windows or Solaris is not affected.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited over TCP port 514.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuc79779[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc79779\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-6392.",
