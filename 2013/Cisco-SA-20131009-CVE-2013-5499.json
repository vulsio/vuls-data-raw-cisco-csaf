An attacker could exploit this issue by obtaining a lease and then releasing it. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be on the same broadcast or collision domain of a targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.\r\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
