To exploit this vulnerability, affected devices must be configured to process SIP messages. Limited Cisco IOS Software releases are affected.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\nThere are no workarounds for devices that must run SIP; however, mitigations are available to limit exposure to the vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20131106-sip[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20131106-sip\"]",

				"text": "Cisco devices are affected when they are running affected Cisco IOS Software releases that are configured to process SIP messages. The following Cisco IOS Software releases are affected by this vulnerability:\r\n\r\n    15.1(4)GC and 15.1(4)GC1\r\n    15.1(4)M4, 15.1(4)M5 and 15.1(4)M6\r\n\r\nRecent releases of Cisco IOS Software do not process SIP messages by default. Creating a dial peer by issuing the dial-peer voice configuration command will start the SIP processes, causing the Cisco IOS device to process SIP messages. In addition, several features within Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express, such as ePhones, will also automatically start the SIP process when they are configured, causing the device to start processing SIP messages. An example of an affected configuration follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n!\n dial-peer voice  voip\n ...\n!\r\n\r\nIn addition to inspecting the Cisco IOS device configuration for a dial-peer command that causes the device to process SIP messages, administrators can also use the show processes | include SIP command to determine whether Cisco IOS Software is running the processes that handle SIP messages. In the following example, the presence of the processes CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET or CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET indicates that the Cisco IOS device will process SIP messages:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show processes | include SIP\r\n 149 Mwe 40F48254            4          1    400023108/24000  0 CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET\r\n 150 Mwe 40F48034            4          1    400023388/24000  0 CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET\r\n\r\nNote: Because there are several ways that a device running Cisco IOS Software can start processing SIP messages, it is recommended that the show processes | include SIP command be used to determine whether the device is processing SIP messages instead of relying on the presence of specific configuration commands.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\" or \"Cisco IOS Software.\" The image name displays in parentheses, followed by \"Version\" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\nCisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\r\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\r\nCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\r\nCompiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team\n\r\n!–- output truncated\r\n\r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in the white paper Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide available at: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"].",

				"text": "SIP is a popular signaling protocol that is used to manage voice and video calls across IP networks such as the Internet. SIP is responsible for handling all aspects of call setup and termination. Voice and video are the most popular types of sessions that SIP handles, but the protocol has the flexibility to accommodate other applications that require call setup and termination. SIP call signaling can use UDP port 5060, TCP port 5060, or Transport Layer Security (TLS) on TCP port 5061 as the underlying transport protocol.\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in session initiation protocol functionality of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a memory leak or a device reload.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of specially crafted SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific valid SIP messages to the SIP gateway.  An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a memory leak or a device reload.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is triggered when a device that is running Cisco IOS Software processes specific, valid SIP messages. Only traffic destined to the device can trigger the vulnerability; transit SIP traffic is not an exploit vector. This vulnerability can be exploited with SIP over IPv4 or IPv6 communications protocol.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: In cases where SIP is running over TCP transport, a TCP three-way handshake is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID: CSCuc42558[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuc42558\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and CSCug25383[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug25383\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only). This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2013-5553.",

				"text": "If the affected Cisco IOS device requires SIP for VoIP services, SIP cannot be disabled, and no workarounds are available. Users are advised to apply mitigation techniques to help limit exposure to the vulnerability. Mitigation consists of allowing only legitimate devices to connect to affected devices. To increase effectiveness, the mitigation must be coupled with anti-spoofing measures on the network edge. This action is required because SIP can use UDP as the transport protocol.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document \"Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco IOS Software Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability\", which is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=31516[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=31516\"]\n\r\nDisabling SIP Listening Ports\r\nFor devices that do not require SIP to be enabled, the simplest and most effective workaround is to disable SIP processing on the device. Some releases of Cisco IOS Software allow administrators to disable SIP with the following commands:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsip-ua\n no transport udp\n no transport tcp\n no transport tcp tls\r\n\r\nWarning: When applying this workaround to devices that are processing Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or H.323 calls, the device will not stop SIP processing while active calls are being processed. Under these circumstances, this workaround should be implemented during a maintenance window when active calls can be briefly stopped.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe show udp connections, show tcp brief all, and show control-plane host open-ports commands can be used to confirm that the SIP UDP and TCP ports are closed after applying this workaround.\n\r\n\n\r\nDepending on the Cisco IOS Software release in use, when SIP is disabled the output from the show ip sockets command may still show the SIP ports open, but sending traffic to them will cause the SIP process to emit the following message:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Nov 2 11:36:47.691: sip_udp_sock_process_read: SIP UDP Listener is DISABLED\r\n\r\nControl Plane Policing\r\nFor devices that need to offer SIP services, it is possible to use Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to block SIP traffic to the device from untrusted sources. Cisco IOS Releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP may be configured on a device to protect the management and control planes to minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The following example can be adapted to specific network configurations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n!– The 192.168.1.0/24 network and the 172.16.1.1 host are trusted.\r\n!– Everything else is not trusted. The following access list is used\r\n!– to determine what traffic needs to be dropped by a control plane\r\n!– policy (the CoPP feature): if the access list matches (permit)\r\n!– then traffic will be dropped and if the access list does not\r\n!– match (deny) then traffic will be processed by the router.\n\r\naccess-list 100 deny udp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5061\r\naccess-list 100 deny udp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5061\r\naccess-list 100 permit udp any any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5061\n\r\n!– Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4\r\n!– traffic in accordance with existing security policies and\r\n!– configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent\r\n!– to infrastructure devices.\r\n!– Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by\r\n!– the CoPP feature.\n\r\nclass-map match-all drop-sip-class\r\n  match access-group 100\n\r\n!– Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the\r\n!– Control-Plane of the device.\n\r\npolicy-map control-plane-policy\r\n class drop-sip-class\r\n  drop\n\r\n!– Apply the Policy-Map to the Control-Plane of the\r\n!– device.\r\n\r\ncontrol-plane\r\n service-policy input control-plane-policy\r\n\r\nNote: Because SIP can use UDP as a transport protocol, it is possible to spoof the source address of an IP packet, which may bypass access control lists that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. Additional information on understanding unicast reverse path forwarding can be found at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/unicast-rpf.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/unicast-rpf.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the above CoPP example, the access control entries (ACEs) that match the potential exploit packets with the \"permit\" action result in these packets being discarded by the policy-map \"drop\" function, while packets that match the \"deny\" action (not shown) are not affected by the policy-map \"drop\" function. Additional information on the configuration and use of the CoPP feature can be found at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/coppwp_gs.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/coppwp_gs.html\"] and http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gtrtlimt.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gtrtlimt.html\"].",

This action is required because SIP can use UDP as the transport protocol.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document \"Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco IOS Software Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability\", which is available at the following link: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=31516[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=31516\"]\n\r\nDisabling SIP Listening Ports\r\nFor devices that do not require SIP to be enabled, the simplest and most effective workaround is to disable SIP processing on the device. Some releases of Cisco IOS Software allow administrators to disable SIP with the following commands:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsip-ua\n no transport udp\n no transport tcp\n no transport tcp tls\r\n\r\nWarning: When applying this workaround to devices that are processing Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or H.323 calls, the device will not stop SIP processing while active calls are being processed. Under these circumstances, this workaround should be implemented during a maintenance window when active calls can be briefly stopped.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe show udp connections, show tcp brief all, and show control-plane host open-ports commands can be used to confirm that the SIP UDP and TCP ports are closed after applying this workaround.\n\r\n\n\r\nDepending on the Cisco IOS Software release in use, when SIP is disabled the output from the show ip sockets command may still show the SIP ports open, but sending traffic to them will cause the SIP process to emit the following message:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Nov 2 11:36:47.691: sip_udp_sock_process_read: SIP UDP Listener is DISABLED\r\n\r\nControl Plane Policing\r\nFor devices that need to offer SIP services, it is possible to use Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to block SIP traffic to the device from untrusted sources. Cisco IOS Releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP may be configured on a device to protect the management and control planes to minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The following example can be adapted to specific network configurations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n!– The 192.168.1.0/24 network and the 172.16.1.1 host are trusted.\r\n!– Everything else is not trusted. The following access list is used\r\n!– to determine what traffic needs to be dropped by a control plane\r\n!– policy (the CoPP feature): if the access list matches (permit)\r\n!– then traffic will be dropped and if the access list does not\r\n!– match (deny) then traffic will be processed by the router.\n\r\naccess-list 100 deny udp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5061\r\naccess-list 100 deny udp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5061\r\naccess-list 100 permit udp any any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5060\r\naccess-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5061\n\r\n!– Permit (Police or Drop)/Deny (Allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4\r\n!– traffic in accordance with existing security policies and\r\n!– configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent\r\n!– to infrastructure devices.\r\n!– Create a Class-Map for traffic to be policed by\r\n!– the CoPP feature.\n\r\nclass-map match-all drop-sip-class\r\n  match access-group 100\n\r\n!– Create a Policy-Map that will be applied to the\r\n!– Control-Plane of the device.\n\r\npolicy-map control-plane-policy\r\n class drop-sip-class\r\n  drop\n\r\n!– Apply the Policy-Map to the Control-Plane of the\r\n!– device.\r\n\r\ncontrol-plane\r\n service-policy input control-plane-policy\r\n\r\nNote: Because SIP can use UDP as a transport protocol, it is possible to spoof the source address of an IP packet, which may bypass access control lists that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses.
