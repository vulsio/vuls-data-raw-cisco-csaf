				"text": "A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the integrity and availability of the affected system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to validate user-supplied input used in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs including SQL statements. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity and availability of some functions.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be able to authenticate to a targeted device to submit malicious SQL statements. In addition, the attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside. These access requirements could reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
