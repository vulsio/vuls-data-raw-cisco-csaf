An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the affected device to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. An exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the affected web browser with the privileges of the user.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.",
