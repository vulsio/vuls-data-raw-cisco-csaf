				"text": "A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Web Conferencing Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass certain access-control settings which may lead to the disclosure of information due to the attacker accessing restricted pages.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of parameters passed by the endpoint client to the server.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying requests from the client or crafting malicious HTTP requests and submitting them to the affected system. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to access certain areas of the web interface that require authorization.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need access to trusted, internal networks where the targeted device may reside in order to submit malicious HTTP request to an affected device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
