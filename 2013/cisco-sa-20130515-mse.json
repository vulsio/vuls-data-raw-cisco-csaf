The Cisco TelePresence Supervisor MSE 8050 is the core of the Cisco TelePresence MSE 8000 Series and provides management service for the chassis and other Cisco TelePresence products that are supported as part of the Cisco TelePresence MSE 8000 Series.\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in  the network stack of the Cisco TelePresence MSE 8050\r\nSupervisor could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high\r\nCPU utilization and a reload of the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is\r\ndue to improper handling and processing of TCP connection requests sent at\r\na high rate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\r\na sequence of TCP segments at a high rate to the management IP address\r\nof the affected system.Â A full TCP three-way handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU utilization, which may trigger a reload of the affected system and cause a denial of service condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCuf76076[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf76076\"] (registered[\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and CSCuf79763[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf79763\"] (registered[\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2013-1236",
