				"text": "A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection attack.\r\n\r\n The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to certain parts of the web management interface. To send the malicious request, the attacker needs a valid login session in the web management interface as a privilege level 15 user. Depending on the configuration of the affected switch, the malicious request must be sent via HTTP or HTTPS. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the root user.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

If both of the following lines are present in the configuration, the web management interface is disabled and the device is not vulnerable:\r\n\r\n\r\nno ip http server\r\nno ip http secure server\r\n\r\nAny other output indicates that the web management interface is enabled on the device.\r\n\r\nIn the web management interface, the HTTP Service and HTTPS Service are configured under Security > TCP/UDP Service.",
