				"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Short Message Service (SMS) handling functionality of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper processing of SMS protocol data units (PDUs) that are encoded with a special character set. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious SMS message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the wireless WAN (WWAN) cellular interface module on an affected device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-sms-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-sms-dos\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 27, 2019, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 17 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 19 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2019 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-71135\"].",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco routers that have a Sierra Wireless WWAN cellular interface module installed and that are running either Cisco IOS Software Release 15.8(3)M or Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.10.1. The SMS handling functionality is enabled by default only when an active subscriber identity module (SIM) card is installed on a Sierra Wireless WWAN cellular interface module.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determining Whether a Device Is Using an Embedded Sierra Wireless WWAN Cellular Interface Module\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco router is using a Sierra Wireless WWAN cellular interface module, use the show inventory | include Sierra Wireless privileged EXEC command on the device. The following example shows the output of the show inventory | include Sierra Wireless command on a router with a Sierra Wireless MC7750 WWAN cellular interface module.\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show inventory | include Sierra Wireless\r\nNAME: \"Modem 0 on Cellular0\", DESCR: \"Sierra Wireless MC7750 4G-V\"\r\n\r\nThe modem slot number, the cellular interface number, and the description differ depending on the platform and the model of the WWAN cellular interface module installed. However, if this command does not exist, or it does not produce any output, the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.\r\n  Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.
