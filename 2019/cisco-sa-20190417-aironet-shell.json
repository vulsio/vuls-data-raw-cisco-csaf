				"text": "A vulnerability in the development shell (devshell) authentication for Cisco Aironet Series Access Points (APs) running the Cisco AP-COS operating system could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access the development shell without proper authentication, which allows for root access to the underlying Linux OS. The attacker would need valid device credentials.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the software improperly validates user-supplied input at the CLI authentication prompt for development shell access. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and entering crafted input at the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the AP development shell without proper authentication, which allows for root access to the underlying Linux OS.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-aironet-shell [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-aironet-shell\"]",

The following example shows the command output for a device running software version 8.3.102.0:\r\n\r\n\r\nAP# show version\r\n.  .  .  cisco AIR-AP3802E-B-K9 ARMv7 Processor rev 1 (v7l) with 1030528/668540K bytes of memory.

The following example shows the command output for a device that is running Cisco WLC Software Release 8.3.102.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n(wlc)> show sysinfo\r\n  Manufacturer's Name.............................. Cisco Systems Inc.  Product Name..................................... Cisco Controller  Product Version.................................. 8.3.102.0  Bootloader Version............................... 1.0.1\r\nField Recovery Image Version..................... 6.0.182.0  Firmware Version.................................

				"text": "Cisco Aironet APs running the Cisco AP-COS OS contain a debugging and troubleshooting mechanism known as devshell. This feature was designed to allow secure, controlled access to the underlying Linux OS and debugging information.\r\nThe devshell feature can provide information that is not accessible through existing show or debug commands. Cisco development engineers can request low-level information through this feature without having to update the software running on a device.  This can provide several advantages, such as allowing the collection of data without a reboot, which can lead to the loss of important values that indicate error state issues, delaying problem resolution.\r\n\r\nAccess to the devshell feature must be explicitly authorized by the customer; Cisco personnel cannot access this feature without customer consent. Once enabled, the devshell feature restricts access to the Linux shell to ensure that no changes are made to critical system files.",
