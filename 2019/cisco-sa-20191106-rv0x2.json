				"text": "Cisco firmware for certain Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers is affected by the following issues:\r\n\r\nCertificate and key issued to QNO Technology\r\nHardcoded password hashes\r\nMultiple vulnerabilities in third-party software (TPS) components\r\n  Certificate and Key Issued to QNO Technology\r\n\r\nAn X.509 certificate with a corresponding public/private key pair was initially found in Cisco RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router firmware. This certificate is issued to third-party entity QNO Technology.\r\n\r\nThe certificate and keys in question are part of the firmware for the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\nRV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router\r\nRV042 Dual WAN VPN Router\r\nRV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router\r\nRV082 Dual WAN VPN Router\r\n\r\nThe certificate and keys were used for testing during the development of the firmware; they were never used for live functionality in any shipping version of the product. All shipping versions of the firmware for the affected products use dynamically created certificates instead.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of this certificate and keys in shipping software was an oversight by the development team for these routers.\r\n\r\nCisco bug ID: CSCvq34370 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvq34370\"]\r\n\r\n  Hardcoded Password Hashes\r\n\r\nThe /etc/shadow file included in Cisco firmware for the following Cisco products contains hardcoded password hashes for the users root, cisco, and lldpd.\r\n\r\nRV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router\r\nRV042 Dual WAN VPN Router\r\nRV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router\r\nRV082 Dual WAN VPN Router\r\n\r\nThe /etc/shadow file is not consulted during user authentication by the firmware. Instead, a dedicated alternate user database is used to authenticate users who log in to the web-based management interface of the affected routers.\r\n\r\nAn attacker with access to the base operating system on an affected device could exploit this issue to obtain elevated privileges at the level of the root, cisco, or lldpd user. However, Cisco is not currently aware of a way to access the base operating system on these routers.\r\n\r\nCisco bug ID: CSCvq34376 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvq34376\"]\r\n\r\n  Multiple Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Software Components\r\nThird-party software (TPS) components in the firmware for the following products contain vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\nRV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router\r\nRV042 Dual WAN VPN Router\r\nRV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router\r\nRV082 Dual WAN VPN Router\r\n\r\nCisco will handle these vulnerabilities by using the regular Cisco process for TPS vulnerabilities in accordance with the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#3psv\"]. For information about known TPS vulnerabilities that affect the firmware for these routers, consult the Cisco Bug Search Tool [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/\"].",
