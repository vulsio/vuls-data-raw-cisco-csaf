				"text": "A vulnerability in 802.1x function of Cisco IOS Software on the Catalyst 6500 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to access the network prior to authentication.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to how the 802.1x packets are handled in the process path. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect to the network on an 802.1x configured port. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to intermittently obtain access to the network.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-c6500 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-c6500\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software if the 802.1x feature is enabled with authentication host-mode being multi-domain, authentication violation being restrict, and in closed authentication mode on a given interface.\r\n\r\nFor information about which software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nAssessing the 802.1x Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the 802.1x feature is configured in a manner that makes a device vulnerable, perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nAdministrators can log in to the device and use the show running-config | include multi-domain command in the CLI to check for the presence of the authentication host-mode multi-domain command in the interface configuration. If the command returns no output, the device is not vulnerable. If the command returns output, identify all the interfaces with the authentication host-mode multi-domain command present and proceed to the next step.\r\nFor each interface identified in the previous step, administrators can use the show running-config command in the CLI to check for the presence of authentication open. For each interface where the authentication mode is configured as open, the device on that interface is not vulnerable. For all other interfaces, complete the next step.\r\nFor each interface identified in the previous steps, administrators can use the show running-config command in the CLI to check for the presence of authentication violation restrict. If this command is present, the interface is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe following shows an example of an AFFECTED configuration:\r\n\r\n\r\ninterface GigabitEthernet1/4/1\r\n switchport   switchport   switchport access vlan 100   switchport mode access   switchport voice vlan 101   authentication event fail action next-method   authentication event server dead action authorize voice   authentication event server alive action reinitialize  authentication host-mode multi-domain   authentication order dot1x mab   authentication priority dot1x mab   authentication port-control auto   authentication periodic   authentication timer reauthenticate server   authentication violation restrict   mab   dot1x pae authenticator   dot1x timeout tx-period 2   spanning-tree portfast edge   spanning-tree bpduguard enable\r\n\r\nThe following shows an example of a NON-AFFECTED configuration:\r\n\r\n\r\ninterface GigabitEthernet1/4/1\r\n switchport   switchport   switchport access vlan 100   switchport mode access   switchport voice vlan 101   authentication event fail action next-method   authentication event server dead action authorize voice   authentication event server alive action reinitialize  authentication host-mode multi-domain   authentication open   authentication order dot1x mab   authentication priority dot1x mab   authentication port-control auto   authentication periodic   authentication timer reauthenticate server   authentication violation shutdown   mab   dot1x pae authenticator   dot1x timeout tx-period 2   spanning-tree portfast edge   spanning-tree bpduguard enable\r\n   Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n                          Cisco IOS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2���in the following field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco IOS Software Checker includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR).
