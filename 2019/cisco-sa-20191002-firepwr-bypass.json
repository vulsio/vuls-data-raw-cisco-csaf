In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCisco Firepower System Software Detection Engine RTF File Policy Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured Malware and File Policy for an RTF file type.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the RTF file syntax. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious RTF file through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured Malware and File Policy for an RTF file type.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2019-12697.\r\n\r\nThe SIR for this vulnerability is Medium.\r\n\r\nCisco Firepower System Software Detection Engine RAR File Policy Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Firepower System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured Malware and File Policy for a RAR file type.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the RAR file syntax. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious RAR file through the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured Malware and File Policy for a RAR file type.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is CVE-2019-12696.\r\n\r\nThe SIR for this vulnerability is Medium.",

Cisco FMC and FTD Software releases 6.0.1 and earlier have reached end of software maintenance. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco FTD Software, customers can do one of the following:\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), use the FMC interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), use the FDM interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.\r\nThe Snort version that is installed depends on the FMC release.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability also applies to the open source Snort project.
