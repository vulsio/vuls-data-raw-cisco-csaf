				"text": "A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 Mobility and Multihoming Protocol (MOBIKE) feature for the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak or a reload of an affected device that leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of certain MOBIKE packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted MOBIKE packets to an affected device to be processed. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually reload, resulting in a DoS condition. The MOBIKE feature is supported only for IPv4 addresses.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-ike-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-ike-dos\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software if configured for MOBIKE1:\r\n\r\n3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)\r\nASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances\r\nASA 5500-X Series Firewalls\r\nASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers\r\nFirepower 4100 Series\r\nFirepower 9300 Security Appliance\r\nFTD Virtual (FTDv)\r\n\r\n  1The MOBIKE support for IPsec IKEv2 remote access VPNs was added as of 9.8(1). The MOBIKE feature is always enabled and cannot be disabled by the user. See the Details [\"#details\"] section for more information.\r\n\r\nMOBIKE is enabled for each Security Association only when the client proposes it and the ASA accepts it. The device should be considered vulnerable if Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) remote access VPN  is configured. The administrator can issue the show running-config command and check for the crypto ikev2 enable <interface> command and the tunnel-group <tunnel_group_name> type remote-access command (also called connection profile).\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version | include Version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.9.2.18:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show version | include Version\r\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.9.2.18  Device Manager Version 7.4(1)  .  .  .\r\n\r\nIf a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM login window or the Device Dashboard tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane.\r\n  Determining the Cisco FTD Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show version\r\n  ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------  Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)  UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c  Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt  VDB version : 279  ----------------------------------------------------",
