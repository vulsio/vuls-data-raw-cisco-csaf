				"text": "A vulnerability in the Secure Shell (SSH) authentication function of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to successfully log in to an affected device using two distinct usernames.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a logic error that may occur when certain sequences of actions are processed during an SSH login event on the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating an SSH session to the device with a specific sequence that presents the two usernames. A successful exploit could result in logging data misrepresentation, user enumeration, or, in certain circumstances, a command authorization bypass.\r\n\r\nSee the Details [\"#details\"] section for more information.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-iosxr-ssh [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190605-iosxr-ssh\"]",

				"text": "The impacts of this vulnerability when the SSH server is enabled are as follows:\r\n\r\nSome logged events will be attributed to the impersonated user.\r\n\r\nExample: Authenticated Attacker A who is assigned the operator task group exploits the vulnerability to impersonate Admin B who is assigned the sysadmin task group. In this case, the attacker could execute all commands that are assigned to the operator task group, but the commands would be reported as being issued by Admin B.\r\nUsername and user task group enumeration can be performed.\r\n\r\nExample: Authenticated Attacker A exploits the vulnerability to impersonate Admin B. If Attacker A issues the CLI command show user <options>, relevant information for Admin B will be returned. If the Admin B username does not exist, the command will not be executed.\r\nAdditionally, if the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) command authorization feature is enabled with the configuration command aaa authorization commands <options>, AAA command authorization bypass can occur.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a logic error that results in the authenticated username being tied to the correct task groups; however, the alternate username is tied to the command authorization requests. The attacker will always retain the task groups that they were assigned as part of the successful authenticated username.\r\n\r\nThe impact of this vulnerability if the command being executed by the authenticated attacker is allowed as part of their task group configuration and AAA command authorization is configured on the device, is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe command will be sent to the AAA server to validate that the command is authorized. This authorization request will be sent as the impersonated username, which may allow the authenticated attacker to execute unauthorized commands.\r\n\r\nExample: Authenticated Attacker A who is assigned the operator task group exploits the vulnerability to impersonate Admin B who is assigned the sysadmin task group. If Attacker A tries to execute a command that is not allowed by the operator task group, but is authorized to the sysadmin group, the command will not be authorized and is not sent to the AAA server for authorization.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample: Authenticated Attacker A who is assigned the operator task group, but with command restrictions imposed via their AAA profile, exploits the vulnerability to impersonate Admin B who is assigned the operator task group, but with no command restrictions imposed via their AAA profile.  If Attacker A tries to execute a command that is allowed by the operator task group, but not allowed in their AAA profile, the command  will be authorized because the command authorization check is performed using the Admin B username.",
