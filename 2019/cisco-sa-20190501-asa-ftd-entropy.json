				"text": "A vulnerability in the Deterministic Random Bit Generator (DRBG), also  known as Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG), used in Cisco Adaptive  Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense  (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a  cryptographic collision, enabling the attacker to discover the private  key of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to  insufficient entropy in the DRBG when generating cryptographic keys. An  attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a large number  of cryptographic keys on an affected device and looking for collisions  with target devices. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to  impersonate an affected target device or to decrypt  traffic secured by  an affected key that is sent to or from an affected target device.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-entropy [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-entropy\"]",

The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show version\r\n  ---------------------[ ftd ]---------------------  Model : Cisco ASA5525-X Threat Defense (75) Version 6.2.0 (Build 362)  UUID : 2849ba3c-ecb8-11e6-98ca-b9fc2975893c  Rules update version : 2017-03-15-001-vrt  VDB version : 279  ----------------------------------------------------",
