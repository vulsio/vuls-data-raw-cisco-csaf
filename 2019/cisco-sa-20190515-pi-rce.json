				"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow a remote attacker to gain the ability to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nOne of these issues, CVE-2019-1821, can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker that has network access to the affected administrative interface.\r\n\r\nThe second and third issues, CVE-2019-1822 and CVE-2019-1823, require that an attacker have valid credentials to authenticate to the impacted administrative interface.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities exist because the software improperly validates user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by uploading a malicious file to the administrative web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code with root-level privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-pi-rce [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-pi-rce\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nFixed Releases\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are fixed in Cisco PI Software Releases 3.4.1, 3.5, and 3.6, and EPN Manager Release 3.0.1.\r\n\r\nNote: Customers running releases of Cisco PI 3.4 must apply the Security Update to the latest maintenance release, PI 3.4.1, to patch these vulnerabilities for PI 3.4.\r\n\r\nNote: Customers running releases of Cisco PI 3.5 must apply the Security Update to PI 3.5.\r\n\r\nCustomers can download the Cisco PI Software from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home\"] on Cisco.com by doing the following:\r\n        Click Browse all.
