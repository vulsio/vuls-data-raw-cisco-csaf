				"text": "A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)-based Ethernet VPN (EVPN) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a logic error that occurs when the affected software processes specific EVPN routing information. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the targeted EVPN network.\r\n\r\nA successful exploit could result in a crash of the l2vpn_mgr process on Provider Edge (PE) device members of the same EVPN instance (EVI). On each of the affected devices, a crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic through the device, resulting in a DoS condition that would require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-iosxr-evpn-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-iosxr-evpn-dos\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and are participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects both Cisco IOS XR 32-bit Software and Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS XR Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determining Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration\r\nThere are two methods for determining whether the device has a vulnerable configuration.\r\n\r\nOption 1: Using the show evpn evi | include EVPN command\r\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show evpn evi | include EVPN command to determine whether the device is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/0/CPU0:Router#show evpn evi | i EVPN\r\nTue May 14 09:40:09.277 EST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVPN-ID     Encap     Bridge Domain                Type\r\n---------- ------ ---------------------------- -------------------  <VPN-ID>   MPLS     <BD-NAME>                      EVPN\r\n\r\nIf this command does not exist, or if it produces an output that does not show the string EVPN within the Type column, the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.\r\n\r\nOption 2: Using the show running-config formal l2vpn | include \"l2vpn bridge group [^ ]+ bridge-domain [^ ]+ evi [0-9]+\" command\r\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show running-config formal l2vpn | include \"l2vpn bridge group [^ ]+ bridge-domain [^ ]+ evi [0-9]+\" command  to determine whether the device is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI.  The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is participating in a BGP MPLS-based EVI:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/0/CPU0:Router#show running-config formal l2vpn | include \"l2vpn bridge group [^ ]+ bridge-domain [^ ]+ evi [0-9]+\"\r\nl2vpn bridge group  bridge-domain  evi\r\n\r\nAn empty output of this command indicates that the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.\r\n\r\nNote: Some hardware/software combinations may not support the show running-config formal command. In that case, use the verification step indicated in Option 1.\r\n  Determining the Cisco IOS XR Software Release\r\n  To determine which Cisco IOS XR Software release is running on a device and the name of the device on which it is running, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the CLI. If the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software or similar text appears in the system banner. The location and name of the system image file that is currently running on the device appears next to the System image file is text. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the name of the system image file.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 6.5.2:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9001#show version\r\nTue May 14 01:32:32.751 EST    Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 6.5.2[Default]  Copyright (c) 2019 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

An attacker that controls multiple Customer Edge (CE) devices could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious traffic patterns into the EVPN network. An exploit could cause the Provider Edge (PE) device to advertise specific MP-BGP EVPN update messages that could result in a crash of the l2vpn_mgr process on PE device members of the same EVI.",
