				"text": "A vulnerability in the data acquisition (DAQ) component of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured access control policies or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly manages system memory resources when inspecting traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating specific traffic patterns for the software to inspect. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory resources used for traffic inspection. Depending on the configuration, the FTD Software could fail open and cease to inspect traffic or fail closed and result in a DoS condition. This vulnerability may require manual intervention to restore the software.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-firepowertds-bypass [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190123-firepowertds-bypass\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software Release 6.3.0 only when running on Firepower 4100 or Firepower 9300 Series Platforms.\r\n\r\nDetermine a Vulnerable FTD Software Configuration\r\n\r\nTo verify whether the FTD Software has a vulnerable configuration, administrators can check access control policies and general configurations. To be considered vulnerable, the configuration must have all of the following:\r\n\r\nAccess control rules that perform URL filtering or invoke file/malware inspection\r\nSSL hardware acceleration enabled (default setting)\r\nAccess control policy advanced settings that do not specify an associated SSL policy to handle encrypted traffic (default setting)\r\n  Note: If the Snort Fail Open: Busy option under Inline Sets > Advanced is enabled, exploit attempts can cause traffic to pass through without inspection when the Snort process is busy. If the Busy option is not enabled, exploit attempts can cause a DoS condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetermine the Cisco Firepower System Software Release\r\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco Firepower System Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco Firepower System Software Release 6.3.0:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show version\r\n-------[ ftd.domain.com ]--------  Model : Cisco Firepower 4140 Threat Defense (76) Version 6.3.0 (Build 83)  UUID : 06870e8a-15a7-11e9-b733-a3ffca9e3696  Rules update version : 2019-01-14-001-vrt  VDB version : 299  ----------------------------------------------------",
