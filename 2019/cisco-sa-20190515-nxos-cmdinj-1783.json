An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by including malicious input as the argument of an affected command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system with elevated privileges.

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the  vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and  expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they  have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or  otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the  terms of the Cisco software license:  https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they  have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco  authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance  upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security  software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license,  additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to  regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available  from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded  contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and  software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the  new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to  contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted  maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco  service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party  vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their  point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be  prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement  to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\n\r\nNo upgrade action is necessary for customers who have already applied a recommended release to address the March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software bundle.
