				"text": "A vulnerability in the software cryptography module of the Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) and Firepower 2100 Series running Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device that results in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a logic error with how the software cryptography module handles IPsec sessions.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating and sending traffic in a high number of IPsec sessions through the targeted device. A successful exploit could cause the device to reload and result in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ipsec-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ipsec-dos\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects only the Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) and Cisco Firepower 2100 Series running Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software Release 9.9.2.18 and configured to support IPsec connections through the device.\r\n\r\nThe device should be considered vulnerable if a crypto map is bound to an interface in the configuration. The administrator can issue the show running-config command and check for the crypto map <cryto_map_name> interface <interface_name> command.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco ASA Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version | include Version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.9.2.18:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show version | include Version\r\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.9.2.18  Device Manager Version 7.4(1)  .  .  .\r\n\r\nIf a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM login window or the Device Dashboard tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane.",
