An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device that should otherwise be denied by the configured ACL. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass protection offered by a configured ACL on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThere are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
