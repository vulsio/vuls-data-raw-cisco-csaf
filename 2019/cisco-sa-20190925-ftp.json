				"text": "A vulnerability in the FTP application layer gateway (ALG) functionality used by Network Address Translation (NAT), NAT IPv6 to IPv4 (NAT64), and the Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZBFW) in Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow that occurs when an affected device inspects certain FTP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a specific FTP transfer through the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-ftp [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190925-ftp\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 25, 2019, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 12 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 13 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2019 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-72547\"].",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software and they are configured with NAT, NAT64, or ZBFW with FTP inspection enabled.\r\n\r\nFor more information about which Cisco IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability can be triggered by traffic that transits an affected device and is inspected by the ALG function. This vulnerability can also be triggered by traffic that is destined to an affected device if the ZBFW is configured to inspect FTP traffic for the self zone.\r\n  Determine Whether NAT Is Configured\r\nTo assess whether a device is configured to perform NAT, administrators can determine whether NAT is active on the device (preferred) or whether NAT commands are present in the device configuration.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether NAT is active on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show ip nat statistics command in the CLI. If NAT is active, the Outside interfaces and Inside interfaces sections of the command output will include at least one interface.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show ip nat statistics command for a device on which NAT is active:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show ip nat statistics\r\n  Total active translations: 0 (0 static, 0 dynamic; 0 extended)  Peak translations: 10, occurred 00:24:01 ago  Outside interfaces:    FastEthernet0/0  Inside interfaces:     FastEthernet0/1  Hits: 134280  Misses: 0  CEF Translated packets: 134270, CEF Punted packets: 10  Expired translations: 11  Dynamic mappings:  -- Inside Source  [Id: 1] access-list NET-192.168.20.0_24 pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0_24 refcount 0   pool POOL-NET-192.168.1.0_24: netmask 255.255.255.0  start 192.168.1.120 end 192.168.1.128  type generic, total addresses 9, allocated 0 (0%), misses 0    Total doors: 0  Appl doors: 0  Normal doors: 0  Queued Packets: 0  Router#\r\n\r\n  If the output of the show ip nat statistics command does not list any interfaces, NAT is not active on the device.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, administrators can determine whether NAT is active on a device by issuing the show running-config command in the CLI and assessing whether NAT commands are present in the device configuration. If NAT is active on the device, the output of the show running-config command will include the ip nat inside and ip nat outside interface commands.\r\n  Determine Whether the NAT ALG Function Is Enabled for FTP\r\nBy default, the NAT ALG function is enabled for FTP and the function does not appear in the running configuration information for a device.\r\n  To determine whether a device is configured with NAT ALG for FTP, administrators can log in to the device and use the show running-config | include ip nat service ftp command in the CLI. If the command output shows the ip nat service ftp command with no preceding it, the NAT ALG is disabled for FTP. The following example demonstrates this condition:\r\n\r\nRouter#show running-config | include ip nat service ftp\r\nno ip nat service ftp  Router#\r\n\r\nIf there is no output for the show running-config | include ip nat service ftp command, the NAT ALG is enabled with FTP.\r\n  Determine Whether NAT64 Is Configured\r\nTo assess whether a device is configured to perform NAT64, administrators can determine whether NAT64 is active on the device (preferred) or whether NAT64 commands are present in the device configuration.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether NAT64 is active on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show nat64 statistics command in the CLI. If NAT64 is active, the Interface Statistics sections of the command output will include at least one interface.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show nat64 statistics command for a device on which NAT64 is active:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show nat64 statistics\r\nNAT64 Statistics    Total active translations: 2 (1 static, 1 dynamic; 1 extended)  Sessions found: 155  Sessions created: 1  Expired translations: 0  Global Stats:     Packets translated (IPv4 -> IPv6)        Stateless: 0        Stateful: 81        MAP-T: 0     Packets translated (IPv6 -> IPv4)        Stateless: 0        Stateful: 75        MAP-T: 0    Interface Statistics     GigabitEthernet1 (IPv4 not configured, IPv6 configured):        Packets translated (IPv4 -> IPv6)           Stateless: 0           Stateful: 0           MAP-T: 0        Packets translated (IPv6 -> IPv4)           Stateless: 0           Stateful: 75           MAP-T: 0        Packets dropped: 0     GigabitEthernet2 (IPv4 configured, IPv6 not configured):        Packets translated (IPv4 -> IPv6)           Stateless: 0           Stateful: 81           MAP-T: 0        Packets translated (IPv6 -> IPv4)           Stateless: 0           Stateful: 0           MAP-T: 0        Packets dropped: 0  Dynamic Mapping Statistics     v6v4  Limit Statistics\r\n\r\nIf the output of the show nat64 statistics command does not list any interfaces, NAT64 is not active on the device.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, administrators can determine whether NAT64 is active on a device by issuing the show running-config command in the CLI and assessing whether NAT64 commands are present in the device configuration. If NAT64 is active on the device, the output of the show running-config command will include the nat64 enable interface commands.\r\n  Determine Whether the NAT64 ALG Function Is Enabled for FTP\r\nBy default, the NAT64 ALG function is enabled for FTP and the function does not appear in the running configuration information for a device.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a device is configured with NAT64 ALG for FTP, administrators can log in to the device and use the show running-config | include nat64 service ftp command in the CLI. If the command output shows the nat64 service ftp command with no preceding it, the NAT64 ALG is disabled for FTP. The following example demonstrates this condition:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show running-config | include nat64 service ftp\r\n  no nat64 service ftp  Router#\r\n\r\nIf there is no output for the show running-config | include nat64 service ftp command, the NAT64 ALG is enabled with FTP.\r\n  Determine Whether a Zone-Based Policy Firewall Is Configured\r\nTo assess whether a device is configured with a ZBFW, administrators can log in to the device and use the show zone security command in the CLI. If the command output shows a member interface under a zone name, the device is vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that has ZBFW rules configured on both the GigabitEthernet0/0 and GigabitEthernet0/1 member interfaces:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show zone security\r\nzone self\r\nDescription: System defined zone\r\n\r\nzone inside\r\nDescription: *** Inside Network ***\r\nMember Interfaces:\r\nGigabitEthernet0/0\r\n\r\nzone outside\r\nDescription: *** Outside Network ***\r\nMember Interfaces:\r\nGigabitEthernet0/1\r\n\r\nRouter#\r\n  Determine Whether the ZBFW ALG Function Is Inspecting FTP\r\nBy default, the ZBFW ALG is disabled for FTP.\r\n\r\nIf the ZBFW ALG function has been configured with no protocol defined  for the class being inspected, the ZBFW ALG function defaults to  inspecting all protocols. A device with this configuration is  vulnerable.\r\n\r\n  The device is also vulnerable if the ZBFW ALG function is configured to inspect FTP, FTPS, or both. To determine the status of the ZBFW ALG function for FTP, administrators can log in to the device and use the show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol ftp command in the CLI to determine whether FTP inspection has been explicitly configured. If the output returns a match on ftp or ftps, the device is vulnerable. The following example demonstrates this condition:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show policy-map type inspect zone-pair | include Match: protocol ftp\r\n       Match: protocol ftp          Match: protocol ftps",

Disabling FTP ALG will prevent FTP transactions through the device from working properly.",
