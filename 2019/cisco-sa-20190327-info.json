				"text": "A vulnerability in the Secure Storage feature of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive system information on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper memory operations performed at encryption time, when affected software handles configuration updates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by retrieving the contents of specific memory locations of an affected device. A successful exploit could result in the disclosure of keying materials that are part of the device configuration, which can be used to recover critical system information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-info [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-info\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices with the Secure Storage feature enabled that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software.\r\n\r\nThere are two bugs linked to this advisory that both address the same vulnerability:\r\n\r\nCisco bug CSCvg97571 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvg97571\"] was raised to address the code changes in Cisco IOS Software Release 15.6(3) M1 or subsequent releases.\r\nCisco bug CSCvi66418 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvi66418\"]  was raised to address the code changes in Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.6.1 or subsequent releases.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determining Whether Secure Storage is Enabled\r\nThere are two methods for determining whether the Secure Storage feature is enabled on a device:\r\n\r\nOption 1: Using the show running-config all | include service private-config-encryption Command.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a device is configured with the Secure Storage feature enabled, use the show running-config all | include service  private-config-encryption  privileged EXEC command on the device. The following example shows the output of the show running-config all |  include service  private-config-encryption command on a Cisco device that has the Secure Storage feature enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config all | include service private-config-encryption\r\nservice private-config-encryption\r\n\r\nIf this command does not exist, or if it produces any other output, the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.\r\n\r\nOption 2: Using the show parser encrypt file status | include Feature Command.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the Secure Storage feature is enabled on a device, use the show parser encrypt file status | include Feature privileged EXEC command on the device. The following example shows the output of the show parser encrypt file status | include Feature command on a Cisco device that has the Secure Storage feature enabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show parser encrypt file status | include Feature\r\nFeature:            Enabled\r\n\r\nIf this command does not exist, or if it produces any other output, the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.\r\n  Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

If the device is running Cisco IOS XE Software, the system banner displays Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, or similar text.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.2.1 and has an installed image name of CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nios-xe-device# show version\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, Catalyst L3 Switch Software (CAT3K_CAA-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version Denali 16.2.1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2016 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n                        Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S���in the following field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco IOS Software Checker includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the Impact Rating drop-down list.\r\n\r\nFor a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032\"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754\"], or Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252\"], depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.",
