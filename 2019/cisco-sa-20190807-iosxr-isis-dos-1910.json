				"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Intermediate System���to���Intermediate System (IS���IS) routing protocol functionality in Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker who is in the same IS���IS area to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of crafted IS���IS link-state protocol data units (PDUs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted link-state PDU to an affected system to be processed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all routers within the IS���IS area to unexpectedly restart the IS���IS process, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-iosxr-isis-dos-1910 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-iosxr-isis-dos-1910\"]\r\n  A companion advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-iosxr-isis-dos-1918 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190807-iosxr-isis-dos-1918\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software earlier than Release 6.6.3 and are configured with the IS���IS routing protocol.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed that this vulnerability affects both Cisco IOS XR 32-bit Software and Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software.\r\n  Determining Whether the Device Has a Vulnerable Configuration\r\n  To determine if the device is configured for IS���IS routing, administrators can use the show running-config router isis EXEC command in the CLI. If the router is configured with IS���IS routing, it will return output. The following example shows the output of the show running-config router isis command on a device that is configured as a level 1 IS���IS router.\r\n\r\nThe device is affected if it is configured as one of the following: is-type level-1, level-1-2 or level-2-only.\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP1/CPU0:IOSXR#show running-config router isis\r\nSun May 26 05:20:23.088 UTC  router isis core  is-type level-1  net 49.0001.1921.6825.5091.00  address-family ipv4 unicast  !  interface TenGigE0/0/0/1    address-family ipv4 unicast   !\r\n\r\nThe following output includes two adjacencies. For the device to be exploitable, it would need at least one formed IS���IS adjacency:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP1/CPU0:IOSXR#show isis adjacency\r\n  IS-IS p Level-1 adjacencies:  System Id      Interface        SNPA           State Hold     Changed  NSF      BFD  12a4           PO0/1/0/1        *PtoP*         Up    23       00:00:06 Capable  Init  12a4           TenGigE0/0/0/1   0004.2893.f2f6 Up    56       00:04:01 Capable  Up    Total adjacency count: 2   !",

Customers who experience an outage due to this vulnerability are advised to contact their support organization.\r\n\r\nCisco recommends that customers ensure the authentication of routers within the IS���IS area for adjacency establishment (Hello packets) and for link-state PDUs before implementing IS���IS. If this best practice is followed, then only an authenticated attacker within the same IS���IS area who sends the crafted IS���IS link-state PDU could exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco also recommends that customers enable Non-Stop Forwarding and/or Non-Stop Routing.",
