				"text": "A vulnerability in the detection engine of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to send data directly to the kernel of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the software improperly filters Ethernet frames sent to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to the management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the Layer 2 (L2) filters and send data directly to the kernel of the affected device. A malicious frame successfully delivered would make the target device generate a specific syslog entry.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-bypass [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190501-asa-ftd-bypass\"]",

For information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determining the Cisco ASA Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco ASA Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version | include Version command in the CLI, and refer to the output of the command. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco ASA Software Release 9.9.2.18:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show version | include Version\r\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 9.9.2.18  Device Manager Version 7.4(1)  .  .  .\r\n\r\nIf a device is managed by using Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), administrators can also determine which release is running on a device by referring to the release information in the table that appears in the Cisco ASDM login window or the Device Dashboard tab of the Cisco ASDM Home pane.\r\nDetermining the Cisco FTD Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco FTD Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the CLI. The following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco FTD Software Release 6.2.2:\r\n\r\n\r\n> show version\r\n  ------------------[ ftd ]-----------------------  Model : Cisco Firepower 2130 Threat Defense (77) Version 6.2.2 (Build 81)  UUID : 0cd3595a-7efa-11e7-aaa1-ee3989c8bf25  Rules update version : 2017-12-20-001-vrt  VDB version : 290  ----------------------------------------------------",

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party  vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to  upgrade to an appropriate release  [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in the applicable table in this section.
