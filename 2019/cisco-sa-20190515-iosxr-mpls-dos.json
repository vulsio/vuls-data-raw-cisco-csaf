				"text": "A vulnerability in the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) implementation of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers  could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain MPLS OAM packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS OAM packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the lspv_server process to crash. The crash could lead to system instability and the inability to process or forward traffic though the device, resulting in a DoS condition that require manual intervention to restore normal operating conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-iosxr-mpls-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190515-iosxr-mpls-dos\"]",

The following example shows the output of the command for a device that has the MPLS OAM feature enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9001#show running-config mpls oam\r\nTue Feb 19 12:45:37.011 UTC\r\nmpls oam\r\n\r\nAn empty output of this command indicates that the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory.\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco IOS XR Software Release\r\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XR Software release is running on a device and the name of the device on which it is running, administrators can log in to the device and use the show version command in the CLI. If the device is running Cisco IOS XR Software, Cisco IOS XR Software or similar text appears in the system banner. The location and name of the system image file that is currently running on the device appears next to the System image file is text. The name of the hardware product appears on the line after the name of the system image file.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show version command on a device that is running Cisco IOS XR Software release 5.3.3  Service Pack 10:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9001#show version\r\nWed Jan 24 01:32:32.751 EST    Cisco IOS XR Software, Version 5.3.3[Default]  Copyright (c) 2017 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain MPLS OAM packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS OAM packets to an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the same MPLS domain as the targeted device, which must be configured to process MPLS OAM packets.
