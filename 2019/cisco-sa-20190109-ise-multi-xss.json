In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCisco Identity Services Engine Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data that is written to log files and displayed in certain web pages of the web-based management interface of an affected device.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific link or view an affected log file. The injected script code may be executed in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-15440\r\n\r\nThe Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium\r\n\r\nCisco Identity Services Engine Reflected Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web-based interface.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters passed to the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of the interface to click a specific link.  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based management interface or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CVE ID for this vulnerability is: CVE-2018-15463\r\n\r\nThe Security Impact Rating (SIR) for this vulnerability is: Medium",
