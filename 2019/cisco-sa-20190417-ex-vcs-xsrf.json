				"text": "A vulnerability in the FindMe feature of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a maliciously crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the privileges of the user. The arbitrary actions include adding an attacker-controlled device and redirecting calls intended for a specific user.\r\n\r\nFor more information about CSRF attacks and potential mitigations, see Understanding Cross-Site Request Forgery Threat Vectors [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28726\"].\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-ex-vcs-xsrf [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-ex-vcs-xsrf\"]",
