An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device via HTTP or HTTPS and requesting specific URLs. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download the router configuration or detailed diagnostic information.\r\n\r\nUpdate, April 4, 2019: The initial fix for this vulnerability was found to be incomplete. The complete fix is now available in Firmware Release 1.4.2.22.\r\n\r\nFirmware updates that address this vulnerability are currently available.
