An attacker who has administrator privileges and access to the network where the IPMI resides could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\nCisco UCS C-Series and S-Series Servers\r\n\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to the appropriate Cisco UCS C-Series and S-Series software release as  indicated in the following table:\r\n                                Cisco IMC Software Release              First Fixed Release                                              1.4              Not vulnerable                                              1.5              1.5(9g)\r\n                                  2.0              2.0(13o)\r\n                                  3.0              3.0(4k)                                  4.0              4.0(2f), 4.0(4b)\r\nCustomers can download Cisco IMC Software from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home\"] on Cisco.com by doing the following:\r\n\r\nClick Browse all.\r\nNavigate to Servers - Unified Computing > UCS C-Series Rack-Mount Standalone Server Software.\r\nIn the right pane, choose the appropriate Cisco UCS C-Series platform.\r\nOn the Select a Software Type page, click Unified Computing System (UCS) Server Firmware.\r\nAccess releases by using the left pane of the page.\r\n\r\nCisco UCS E-Series Servers\r\n\r\nCisco fixed this vulnerability in Cisco IMC Software Release 3.2(8) for Cisco UCS E-Series Servers.\r\n\r\nCustomers can download the software from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home\"] on Cisco.com by doing the following:\r\n\r\nClick Browse all.\r\nNavigate to Servers - Unified Computing > UCS E-Series Software.\r\nIn the right pane, choose the appropriate Cisco UCS E-Series platform.\r\nOn the Select a Software Type page, click Unified Computing System (UCS) Server Firmware.\r\nAccess releases by using the left pane of the page.\r\n\r\nCisco 5000 Series Enterprise Network Compute System Platforms\r\n\r\nCisco fixed this vulnerability in Cisco IMC Software Release 3.2(8) for Cisco 5000 Series ENCS platforms.\r\n\r\nCustomers can download the software from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home\"] on Cisco.com by doing the following:\r\n\r\nClick Browse all.\r\nNavigate to Routers > Network Functions Virtualization > 5000 Series Enterprise Network Compute System.\r\nIn the right pane, choose the appropriate ENCS platform.\r\nOn the Select a Software Type page, click ENCS Software.\r\nAccess releases by using the left pane of the page.",
