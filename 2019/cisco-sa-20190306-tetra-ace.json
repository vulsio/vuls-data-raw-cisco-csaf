				"text": "A vulnerability in the Tetration Analytics agent for Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code as root.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an incorrect permissions setting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by replacing valid agent files with malicious code. A successful exploit could result in the execution of code supplied by the attacker.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 25 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 26 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-70757\"].",

To verify whether Feature Analytics is enabled, administrators can execute the show feature CLI command.  The following example shows the output of this command on a device with this feature disabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nN9K-A# show feature\r\n  Feature Name          Instance  State     --------------------  --------  --------  analytics             1         disabled\r\n\r\nDetermining the Cisco NX-OS Software Release\r\nAdministrators can check the release of Cisco NX-OS Software that is running on a device by using the show version command in the device CLI. The following example shows the output of this command on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software Release 7.0(3)I5(1):\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos-switch# show version\r\nCisco Nexus Operating System (NX-OS) Software  TAC support: http://www.cisco.com/tac  Copyright (C) 2002-2016, Cisco and/or its affiliates.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\n\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in the applicable table in this section. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution, customers should consider that this advisory is part of a bundled publication. The following page provides a complete list of bundle advisories: Cisco Event Response: March 2019 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-70757\"].\r\n\r\nIn the following tables, the left column lists releases of Cisco FXOS Software or Cisco NX-OS Software. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by all the vulnerabilities described in this bundle and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the releases listed in the right column of each table include fixes for the vulnerabilities, the fix related to the Cisco NX-OS Software Image Signature Verification Vulnerability [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190306-nxos-sig-verif\"] requires a BIOS upgrade as part of the software upgrade.
