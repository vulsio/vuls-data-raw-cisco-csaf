An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect  to the device via SSH. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the configuration as an administrative user if the  default credentials are not changed.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
