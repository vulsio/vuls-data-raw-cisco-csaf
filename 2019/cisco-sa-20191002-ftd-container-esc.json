				"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the multi-instance feature of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape the container for their FTD instance and execute commands with root privileges in the host namespace.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to insufficient protections on the underlying filesystem. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by modifying critical files on the underlying filesystem. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges within the host namespace. This could allow the attacker to impact other running FTD instances.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-ftd-container-esc [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-ftd-container-esc\"]\r\n  This advisory is part of the October 2019 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 10 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 18 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: October 2019 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-72541\"].",

If the Deploy Type field has a value of Container, application instances are present and the device is vulnerable. The following example shows the command output for a vulnerable device:\r\n\r\n\r\nfirepower# scope ssa\r\nfirepower /ssa # show app-instance   App Name   Identifier Slot ID    Admin State Oper State       Running Version Startup Version Deploy Type Turbo Mode Profile Name Cluster State   Cluster Role  ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------- ---------------- --------------- --------------- ----------- ---------- ------------ --------------- ------------  ftd        ftd1       1          Enabled     Online           6.2.3.14        6.2.3.14        Native      No                      Not Applicable  None  ftd        ftd2-1     2          Enabled     Online           6.4.0.4         6.4.0.4         Container   No         mid          Not Applicable  None",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following tables, the left column lists releases of Cisco ASA Software, Cisco FMC Software, or Cisco FTD Software. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by any of the vulnerabilities described in this bundle and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nCisco FTD Software\r\n                                Cisco FTD Software Release              First Fixed Release for These Vulnerabilities              First Fixed Release for All Vulnerabilities Described in the Bundle of Advisories                                              Earlier than 6.1.01              Multi-instance not supported.
