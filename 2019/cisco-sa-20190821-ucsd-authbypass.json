In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\nCisco fixed this vulnerability in the following software releases:\r\n\r\nCisco UCS Director 6.7.2.0 and later (recommended: 6.7.3.0)\r\nCisco UCS Director Express for Big Data 3.7.2.0 and later (recommended: 3.7.3.0)\r\n\r\n  Customers can download Cisco UCS Director software from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home\"] at Cisco.com by doing the following:\r\n\r\nClick Browse all.\r\nChoose Servers - Unified Computing > UCS Director > UCS Director 6.7.\r\nAccess releases by using the left pane of the UCS Director 6.7 page.\r\n\r\n  Customers can download Cisco UCS Director Express for Big Data software from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home\"] at Cisco.com by doing the following:\r\n\r\nClick Browse all.\r\nChoose Servers - Unified Computing > UCS Director > UCS Director Express for Big Data 3.7.\r\nAccess releases by using the left pane of the UCS Director Express for Big Data 3.7 page.",
