				"text": "A vulnerability in the Network Address Translation 64 (NAT64) functions of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause either an interface queue wedge or a device reload.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of certain IPv4 packet streams that are sent through the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IPv4 packet streams through the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to either cause an interface queue wedge or a device reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-nat64 [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190327-nat64\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 27, 2019, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 17 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 19 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: March 2019 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-71135\"].",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software and are configured with either NAT64 (Stateless or Stateful), Mapping of Address and Port Using Translation (MAP-T), or Mapping of Address and Port Using Encapsulation (MAP-E).\r\n\r\nFor more information about which Cisco IOS Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determining the NAT64 Configuration\r\nAdministrators can identify devices that have either NAT64 (Stateless or Stateful), MAP-T, or MAP-E by using the show running-config | include nat64 enable|nat64 map-t|nat64 map-e command in the CLI. If the command returns output with nat64 in it, the device is vulnerable. The following example shows the output of the command on a device with NAT64 enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show running-config | include nat64 enable|nat64 map-t|nat64 map-e\n nat64 enable  nat64 enable nat64 prefix stateless 2001:DB9:0:1::/96 nat64 route 192.1.1.0/24 GigabitEthernet0/1 Router#\r\n  Determining the Cisco IOS Software Release\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS Software release is running on a device, administrators can log in to the device, use the show version command in the CLI, and then refer to the system banner that appears. If the device is running Cisco IOS Software, the system banner displays text similar to Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software or Cisco IOS Software. The banner also displays the installed image name in parentheses, followed by the Cisco IOS Software release number and release name. Some Cisco devices do not support the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.5(2)T1 and has an installed image name of C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version\r\n  Cisco IOS Software, C2951 Software (C2951-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.5(2)T1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)  Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport  Copyright (c) 1986-2015 by Cisco Systems, Inc.

See also the Cisco Security Blog Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained [\"http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/\"].\r\n\r\nIn the event of exploitation, if the source of the exploit traffic is identified and subsequently blocked so that this traffic doesn't continue to reach the vulnerable device, administrators can increase the hold queue via the interface CLI configuration command hold-queue <number> in until they can reload the router, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#conf t\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z. Router(config)#inte gigabitEthernet 1 Router(config-if)#hold Router(config-if)#hold-queue 350 in Router(config-if)#end Router#",

The policy allows administrators to monitor the interfaces for Cisco IOS device and detect when the interface input queues are full. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade, implement suitable mitigations, or reload the device to clear the input queue.\r\n\r\nThe Tcl script is available for download from the Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community at the following link: https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337 [\"https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-19337\"]\r\n\r\nFor additional information, see the Cisco Security Blog Cisco IOS Queue Wedges Explained [\"http://blogs.cisco.com/security/cisco_ios_queue_wedges_explained/\"].",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades, customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n                         Cisco IOS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides a tool, the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"], that identifies any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use this tool to perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\nInitiate a search by choosing one or more releases from a drop-down list or uploading a file from a local system for the tool to parse\r\nEnter the output of the show version command for the tool to parse\r\nCreate a custom search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a release is affected by any published Cisco Security Advisory, use the Cisco IOS Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] on Cisco.com or enter a Cisco IOS Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2���in the following field:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco IOS Software Checker includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR).
