				"category": "general",
				"text": "For specific version information, refer to the \"Software Versions and Fixes\" section of this advisory.\n\n\n\nCisco ASA and Cisco ASASM contain a vulnerability that may allow an unauthenticated, remote\nattacker to cause the reload of the affected device.\n\n\n\nCisco ASA Software may be affected by this vulnerability if all the following conditions are present: \n\n\n    Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM is running in transparent firewall mode\n    Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM has IPv6 enabled \n    Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM has system logging enabled and the system is configured to log message ID 110003\n\nTo verify that the Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM is running in transparent firewall mode, issue the show firewall command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA running in transparent firewall mode: \r\n\n\nciscoasa# show firewall\nFirewall mode: Transparent\n\nIPv6 is not enabled by default. In order to enable IPv6 on a Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM configured in transparent firewall mode at a minimum a link-local\naddress needs to be configured for IPv6 to operate correctly. If a global address is configured, a\nlink-local address is automatically configured on each interface. \n\n\n\nTo verify that the Cisco ASA or Cisco ASASM has IPv6 enabled, issue the show ipv6 interface command and confirm that the command returns output. The following example shows a Cisco ASA configured with two interfaces (inside and outside) running in transparent firewall mode and IPv6 enabled:\n\n\n\n\nciscoasa# show ipv6 interface\noutside is up, line protocol is up\n  IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is fe80::219:2fff:fe83:4f42\n  No global unicast address is configured\n  Joined group address(es):\n    ff02::1\n    ff02::1:ff83:4f42\n  ICMP error messages limited to one every 100 milliseconds\n  ICMP redirects are enabled\n  ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts: 1\n  ND reachable time is 30000 milliseconds\n  ND advertised retransmit interval is 1000 milliseconds\n  Hosts use stateless autoconfig for addresses.\ninside is up, line protocol is up\n  IPv6 is enabled, link-local address is fe80::219:2fff:fe83:4f43\n  No global unicast address is configured\n  Joined group address(es):\n    ff02::1\n    ff02::1:ff83:4f43\n  ICMP error messages limited to one every 100 milliseconds\n  ICMP redirects are enabled\n  ND DAD is enabled, number of DAD attempts: 1\n  ND reachable time is 30000 milliseconds\n  ND advertised retransmit interval is 1000 milliseconds\n  Hosts use stateless autoconfig for addresses.\nSyslog\nmessage ID 110003 is generated when the Cisco ASA is unable to find the next hop on an interface routing table. Additional information\nregarding this syslog message can be found in the Cisco ASA System Log\nMessages guide at: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6120/products_system_message_guides_list.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps6120/products_system_message_guides_list.html\"].\nLogging is not enabled by default on a Cisco ASA; however, when logging\nis enabled a Cisco ASA will automatically enable syslog message 110003.\n\n\n\nSyslog message 110003 has a default severity level of 6 (informational). Cisco\nASA Software configured for logging at Level 6 or higher (that is Levels 6 through 7) may be vulnerable.\n\nTo verify if logging is enabled, issue the show logging command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with logging enabled and buffer logging enabled at Level 6 (informational):\n\n\nciscoasa# show logging\nSyslog logging: enabled\n    Facility: 20\n    Timestamp logging: disabled\n    Standby logging: disabled\n    Debug-trace logging: disabled\n    Console logging: disabled\n    Monitor logging: disabled\n    Buffer logging: level informational, 2 messages logged\n    Trap logging: disabled\n    Permit-hostdown logging: disabled\n    History logging: disabled\n    Device ID: disabled\n    Mail logging: disabled\n    ASDM logging: disabled\n\n\nUsing a custom message list (created via the logging list\ncommand) that includes syslog message 110003, either by severity or by\nexplicitly including the message ID, is also a vulnerable configuration.\n\n\n\n\nThe default severity level of syslog messages can be changed. If the\ndefault severity level of syslog message 110003 is changed and the\ndevice is configured to log to any destination at the new severity\nlevel, the device is vulnerable.\nDetermine the Running Software Version\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the show version\ncommand. The following example shows a Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive\nSecurity Appliance that is running software version 8.4(1):\n\n\nciscoasa#show version | include Version\nCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) \nDevice Manager Version 6.4(1)\n\nCustomers who use Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) to\nmanage devices can locate the software version in the table that is\ndisplayed in the login window or upper-left corner of the Cisco ASDM\nwindow.\n\nInformation about Cisco PIX Security Appliance\nCisco PIX is not affected by the vulnerability described in\nthis security advisory. Cisco PIX has reached end of maintenance\nsupport. Cisco PIX customers are encouraged to migrate to Cisco ASA. \r\n",
