In some cases, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of a targeted user. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. The players can also be manually installed for offline playback after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html[\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nIf the WRF or ARF players were automatically installed, they will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site.

For example, if client build 27.32.10 is fixed, build 27.32.11 will also contain the software update. Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, such as T27 SP25 EP10. Such an example indicates that the server is running client build 27.25.10.\r\n\r\nNote: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.\r\n\r\n",

The WRF and ARF file formats are used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players are applications that are used to play back and edit recording files, which use the .wrf or .arf extensions. The WRF players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for stream playback mode). \n\r\n\n\r\nThe WRF and ARF players can also be manually installed after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html[\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"] to play back recording files locally (for offline playback mode).\r\n\r\nThe following table provides the Cisco bug IDs and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers that have been assigned for the buffer overflows in this advisory:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Title\r\n            CVE ID\r\n            Cisco Bug ID\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx Arbitrary Code Execution Through ARF Files \r\n            CVE-2012-3053\r\n            CSCtz72985[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz72985\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx Player WRF File Heap Overflow\r\n            CVE-2012-3054\r\n            CSCtz72977[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz72977\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WRF JPEG DHT Chunk Stack Buffer Overflow\r\n            CVE-2012-3055\r\n            CSCtz72953[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz72953\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WRF File Memory Corruption\r\n            CVE-2012-3056\r\n            CSCtz72946[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz72946\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            WRF File Audio Size Heap Overflow\r\n            CVE-2012-3057\r\n            CSCtz00755[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz00755\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\n\r\nExploitation of the vulnerabilities may cause the player application to crash or, in some cases, result in remote code execution.\r\n\n\r\n\r\nTo exploit one of these vulnerabilities, the player application must open a malicious WRF or ARF file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file directly to users (for example, by using e-mail) or by directing a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities cannot be triggered by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.",

				"text": "When considering software upgrades, also consult http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt/\"] and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted maintenance provider for assistance. \r\n\r\nThe following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27) correct the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Client builds 28.1.0 (T28 L10N SP1) \r\n    Client builds 27.32.2 (T27 LD SP32 CP2) \r\n    Client builds 27.25.11 (T27 LC SP25 EP11) \r\n\r\nClient builds prior to T27 SP25 have reached end of support; to obtain fixed software please upgrade to the latest version.\r\n\r\nTo determine the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and navigate to the Support > Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page. Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.25.10 is fixed, build 27.25.11 will also contain the software update. \r\n\r\nThe Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the Cisco WRF and ARF players are all affected. If a player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If a Cisco WebEx recording player was manually installed, users must download the latest version from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html[\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"] and install it. To remove the players completely, access the Meeting Services Removal Tool or Mac Cisco-WebEx Uninstaller (for Apple Mac users) at http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html[\"http://support.webex.com/support/downloads.html\"].\r\n\r\nUsers can determine whether a player is affected by these vulnerabilities by manually verifying the installed version. To do so, users can examine the file version and determine whether it contains the fixed code. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows\r\n\r\nSix dynamic link libraries (DLLs) were updated on the Microsoft Windows platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. These files are in the C:\\Program Files\\WebEx\\Record Playback folder or the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Webex\\Record Player folder. The version number of a DLL can be obtained by browsing the Record Playback directory in Windows Explorer, right-clicking the filename, and choosing Properties. The Version or Details tab of the Properties page provides details on the library version. The following table provides the first fixed version for each DLL. If the installed versions are equal to or greater than the versions provided in the table, the system is not vulnerable. \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Client Build\r\n            Cisco DLL Filename\r\n            DLL File Versions\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            28.1.0\r\n            atjpeg60.dll\r\n            2028,1201,300,500\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.25.11\r\n            ataudio.dll\r\n            27,2300,2012,316\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.25.11\r\n            atas32.dll\r\n            2027,1225,311,1300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.25.11\r\n            atdl2006.dll\r\n            1027, 1225, 311,1300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.25.11\r\n            ATJPEG60.dll\r\n            2027, 1225, 311, 1300\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.25.11\r\n            atpdmod.dll\r\n            2023.1225.300.1600\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.25.11\r\n            nbrpd.dll\r\n            2023.1225.300.1600\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.32.2\r\n            ataudio.dll\r\n            28,32,2012,208\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.32.2\r\n            atas32.dll\r\n            2, 6, 32, 3\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.32.2\r\n            atdl2006.dll\r\n            1027, 1232, 102, 700\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.32.2\r\n            ATJPEG60.dll\r\n            1027, 1232, 102, 700\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.32.2\r\n            atpdmod.dll\r\n            2029.1232.202.900\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            27.32.2\r\n            nbrpd.dll\r\n            2029.1232.202.900\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\nApple Mac\r\n\r\nSix package bundles were updated on the Apple Mac OS platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
