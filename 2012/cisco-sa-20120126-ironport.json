To determine whether the system has Telnet enabled, administrators can use the netstat command and verify that the default Telnet TCP port 23 is in listening state. The following example shows a Cisco ESA with telnet enabled:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoesa> netstat\n\nActive Internet connections (including servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address       (state)\n[...]\ntcp4       0      0 172.18.254.80.21       *.*                    LISTEN\ntcp4       0      0 172.18.254.80.22       *.*                    LISTEN\ntcp4       0      0 172.18.254.80.23       *.*                    LISTEN      \n\n[...]\r\n\r\nDetermining the Running Software Version\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS\r\nSoftware is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco  AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA Software version 7.6.2-201:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoesa> version\nCurrent Version\n===============\nProduct: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance\nModel: X1070\nVersion: 7.6.2-201\n[...]\r\n",

The Cisco SMA is a flexible management tool designed to centralize and consolidate policy and runtime data, providing a single management interface for multiple Cisco IronPort security appliances. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco WSA is a secure web gateway that combines\r\nadvanced malware protection, application visibility and control (AVC),\r\nacceptable use policy controls, reporting, and secure mobility on a\r\nsingle platform.\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in telnet code of Cisco AsyncOS could allow an\r\nunauthenticated, remote attacker to to execute arbitrary code on the\r\naffected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary\r\nchecks when processing telnet encryption keys.  An unauthenticated,\r\nremote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious\r\nrequests to a targeted system.  If successful, the attacker could\r\nexecute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: The Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco WSA is affected by this vulnerability only if the  System Setup Wizard (SSW) has not been performed as the Telnet access is disabled after the setup is completed. \n\r\nCisco WSA will not fully operate unless the SSW has completed; this limits the scope of the vulnerability on Cisco WSA.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug IDs CSCzv32432[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv32432\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco ESA, CSCzv44580[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCzv44580\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco SMA, and CSCuo90523[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuo90523\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco WSA.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability was previously documented in Cisco IronPort bug 83262.
