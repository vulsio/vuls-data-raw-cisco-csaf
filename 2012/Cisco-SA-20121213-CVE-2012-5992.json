				"text": "Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks on a targeted system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input processed by the WLC management web interface of the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to follow a malicious link. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the affected application, which could be used to conduct further attacks.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco confirmed the vulnerability in a security bug report; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco would like to thank security researcher Jacob Holcomb for reporting this vulnerability.",
