Eight of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the September 2012 bundled publication. \r\n\r\nIndividual publication links are in \"Cisco Event Response: Semi-Annual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication\" at the following link: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep12.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep12.html\"]\r\n",

				"text": "A Cisco IOS router is potentially vulnerable when it is running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software, BGP routing is enabled on the router, and the router has at least one established BGP neighbor session.  For more information on affected versions, see the \"Software Versions and Fixes\" section below.\n\r\n\n\r\nA device running Cisco IOS XR has a vulnerable configuration if BOTH of the following conditions are true:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.  BGP mVPN routing is enabled and a neighbor is configured.  The following example shows configuration commands that will be present:\n\r\nrouter bgp \n\r\naddress-family   mvpn\n\r\nneighbor \n\r\n\r\n2.  A neighbor session is established.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: For Cisco IOS XR, the only vulnerable configuration is address-family  mvpn as noted above.  BGP mVPN with MDT is NOT affected.\n\r\n\n\r\nA device running Cisco IOS has an affected configuration if BOTH of the following conditions are true:\n\r\n\n\r\n1.  BGP routing is enabled and a neighbor is configured.  The following example shows configuration commands that will be\r\npresent:\n\r\nrouter bgp \n\r\n\r\nneighbor \n\r\n2.  A BGP neighbor session is established.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nYou can determine if a BGP session is established using the show ip bgp summary command in Cisco IOS Software.  In Cisco IOS XR software, you can determine if a BGP session is established using the show bgp  mvpn all summary command.  The following example shows the output from an IOS router with two neighbor sessions established:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show ip bgp summary \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n!--- output shortened\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeighbor        V    AS MsgRcvd MsgSent   TblVer  InQ OutQ Up/Down State/PfxRcd\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.100.1.1      4   200      26      22      199    0    0 00:14:23 23\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10.200.1.1      4   300      21      51      199    0    0 00:13:40 0\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\" or \"Cisco IOS Software.\" The image name displays in parentheses, followed by \"Version\" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\nRouter> show version \nCisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\nCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\nCompiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team\r\n!--- output truncated \r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in \"White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide\" at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"]. \r\n",
