The FWSM offers firewall services with stateful packet\r\nfiltering and deep packet inspection.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco FWSM is affected by multiple vulnerabilities, which are described in the following sections:\r\n\r\nDCERPC Inspection Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\n\r\nDCERPC is a protocol widely used by Microsoft\r\ndistributed client and server applications that allows software clients\r\nto execute programs on a server remotely. \r\n\r\nA\r\nvulnerability exists in the code of the DCERPC inspection engine that\r\nwould allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the\r\naffected system or to overflow the stack and possibly execute arbitrary\r\ncommands. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of DCERPC\r\npackets within a valid DCERPC session. An attacker could exploit this\r\nvulnerability by sending a crafted DCERPC packet that will be\r\ninspected by the affected system. \n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Only transit traffic can be used to exploit\r\nthis vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and\r\ntransparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. This\r\nvulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtr27522[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr27522\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4661.\n\r\n\n\r\nDCERPC Inspection Denial Of Service Vulnerabilities\n\r\n\n\r\nTwo vulnerabilities exist in the DCERPC inspection engine that would\r\nallow an\r\nunauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected\r\nsystem. The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of DCERPC\r\npackets within a valid DCERPC session. An attacker could exploit this\r\nvulnerability by\r\nsending a crafted DCERPC packet that will be inspected by the\r\naffected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Only transit traffic can be used to exploit\r\nthese vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities affect both routed and\r\ntransparent firewall mode in both single and multi-context mode. These\r\nvulnerabilities can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtr27524[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr27524\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and CSCtr27521[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtr27521\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and have been assigned CVE IDs CVE-2012-4662 and CVE-2012-4663, respectively.\r\n\r\n",
