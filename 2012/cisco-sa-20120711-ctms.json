The output should resemble the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nadmin: show version active\r\nActive Master Version: 1.7.0.0-471\r\n\r\nActive Version Installed Software Options: \r\nNo Installed Software Options Found.\r\n\r\nadmin: show version inactive\r\nInactive Master Version: 1.6.0.0-342\r\n\r\nInactive Version Installed Software Options: \r\nNo Installed Software Options Found.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding example, the system has versions 1.6.0 and 1.7.0 loaded on the device, and version 1.7.0 is currently active. A device is affected only by vulnerabilities that are in the active software version.\r\n",

The vulnerability is due to improper handling of malformed IP packets and TCP connection requests or terminations sent at a high rate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted sequence of malformed IP packets or TCP segments at a high rate.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCty11219[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty11219\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only), CSCty11299[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty11299\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only), CSCty11323[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty11323\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and CSCty11338[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty11338\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-3073.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution Vulnerability \n\r\n\n\r\nA remote code execution vulnerability in the implementation of the Cisco\r\nDiscovery Protocol component could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent\r\nattacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The\r\nvulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle malformed Cisco\r\nDiscovery Protocol packets.  An attacker could exploit this\r\nvulnerability by passing malformed Cisco\r\nDiscovery Protocol packets to an\r\naffected device.  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow the\r\nattacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nBecause Cisco Discovery Protocol works at the data link layer (Layer 2),\r\nan attacker must have a way to submit an Ethernet frame directly to an\r\naffected device. This action may be possible in situations where the affected\r\nsystem is part of a bridged network or connected to a non partitioned\r\ndevice, such as a network hub.\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtz40965[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtz40965\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2012-2486",
