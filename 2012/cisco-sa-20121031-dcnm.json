Both the Cisco DCNM-LAN Server and Cisco DCNM-SAN Server, which are part of the Cisco Prime DCNM solution, are affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNote: Cisco DCNM-LAN Server and Cisco DCNM-SAN Server were different products until release 6.1(1), when both products converged into a single Cisco Prime DCNM product. All releases of Cisco DCNM-LAN Server and Cisco DCNM-SAN are affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo determine the Cisco Prime DCNM release that is running, administrators can connect to the computer that runs the Cisco Prime DCNM software using a web browser and HTTPS; the release number will be displayed in the login page, before logging in. The following example shows a device running version 6.1(1a):\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco Prime\nData Center Network Manager Version: 6.1(1a)",
