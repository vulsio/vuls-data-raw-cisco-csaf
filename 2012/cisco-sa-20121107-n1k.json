				"text": "The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) would like to notify customers of an issue that may impact their network security posture when upgrading the Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switches to Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) with deployments that have Cisco Virtual Security Gateway (VSG) integration. This issue will manifest itself when administrators perform an in-service software upgrade to Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) from Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.1a) or earlier.\r\n\r\nAfter the software upgrade, a bug in Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) could cause all the virtual Ethernet ports on the Virtual Ethernet Modules (VEM) of the Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switch to stay in No-Policy pass-through mode because a valid VSG license is not actively installed. As a result, the VEMs no longer use a configured Cisco VSG; therefore, the virtual machines (VM) are not firewalled and traffic is not inspected by the VSG.\r\n\r\nThis software bug is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCud01427 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud01427\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and a software bulletin for Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) is in the process of being published.\r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\nProblem Symptoms\r\n\r\nThe VEM is in unlicensed mode for VSG, while the Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) of Cisco Nexus 1000V continues to show it licensed.\r\n\r\nConditions\r\n\r\nThis issue affects deployments that have Cisco VSG integration with Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switches. This issue occurs after upgrading the VSM of Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switches to Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) from Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.1a) or earlier.\r\n\r\nAfter an upgrade, the device can enter a state whereby it has active VEM ports but a license is not installed for the VSG, even when the device is configured with permanent VSG licenses. When this occurs, all the virtual Ethernet ports on the VEM that correspond to the VMs are kept in pass-through mode, with traffic not being analyzed by the VSG and hence any policies configured on the VSG are not enforced.\r\n\r\nThis bug is independent of VSM-to-VEM communication (whether in Layer 2 or Layer 3 mode).\r\n\r\nIdentification\r\n\r\nIf the workaround as described below is followed, then this issue will not be seen, and the licenses will be correctly installed.\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade to Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2) has been performed, this issue can be verified from the command-line interface by issuing the command-line interface (CLI) command show vsn detail. In the following example, the VSN-STATE indicates No-License:\r\nnexus1K# show vsn detail\r\n#VSN  VLAN: -, IP-ADDR: 192.168.0.1\r\nMODULE       VSN-MAC-ADDR  FAIL-MODE   VSN-STATE\r\n3                  -      Close  No-License\r\n4                  -      Close  No-License\r\n  Workaround\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading a Cisco Nexus 1000V Series Switch to Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2), the administrator should perform these additional steps:\r\n      After the VSM upgrade is complete, but before the VEM upgrade is initiated, use the system switchover command to initiate a manual switchover. After the switchover, the CLI session will exit.      Login to the VSM and use the show redundancy status CLI command to verify the switchover was successful.\r\n  After the VSM and VEM has been upgraded, use the show vsn detail command to validate the licenses were properly installed. The VSN-STATE should be Up. If the VSM and VEM were upgraded successfully and the licenses were properly installed, then this issue will not be observed.\r\n\r\nOfficial Fix\r\n\r\nCisco will release Software Release 4.2(1)SV1(5.2a) and this response will be updated when a confirmed release date is available.\r\n\r\nCisco Security Procedures\r\nComplete information on reporting security vulnerabilities in Cisco  products, obtaining assistance with security incidents, and registering to  receive security information from Cisco, is available on Cisco's worldwide  website at  http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html [\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/psirt/security_vulnerability_policy.html\"].
