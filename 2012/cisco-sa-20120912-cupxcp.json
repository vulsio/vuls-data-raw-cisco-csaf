				"text": "Cisco Unified Presence and Jabber XCP provide an open and extensible platform that facilitates the secure exchange of availability and instant messaging (IM) information.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco Unified Presence contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nJabber Extensible Communications Platform, including JabberNow Appliance, contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nXMPP clients initiate communication with an XMPP server by sending a stream header using IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6). The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of stream headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted XMPP stream header to an affected system. A successful exploit could cause the Connection Manager processes to terminate, resulting in dropped connections for existing clients and preventing new clients from connecting. The Connection Manager processes will restart automatically. However, repeated exploitation could create a sustained DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nMore information about XMPP stream headers is available in RFC 6120.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtu32832[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtu32832\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-3935.\n",
