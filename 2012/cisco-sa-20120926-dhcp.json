An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a single DHCP packet to or through an affected device, causing the device to reload.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. A workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is available. This advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120926-dhcp[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20120926-dhcp\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: The September 26, 2012, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes nine Cisco Security Advisories. Eight of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one advisory addresses a vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the September 2012 bundled publication. \r\n\r\nIndividual publication links are in \"Cisco Event Response: Semi-Annual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication\" at the following link: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep12.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_sep12.html\"]\r\n\n",

				"text": "Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software versions that include the Device Sensor feature are affected by this vulnerability. Devices that have at least one interface with an IP address are affected.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether the Cisco IOS Software release includes the Device Sensor feature, issue the show subsys command.  \n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows the Device Sensor feature is included:\r\nSwitch#show subsys | include dsensor_lite\r\ndsensor_lite                       Protocol    1.000.001\r\n\r\nTo determine whether an interface is assigned an IP address, issue the show ip interface brief command.  \n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example indicates the FastEthernet1/0 interface is assigned IP address 10.10.10.1:\n\r\n\r\nrouter#show ip interface brief \r\nInterface                  IP-Address      OK?

The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\" or \"Cisco IOS Software.\" The image name displays in parentheses, followed by \"Version\" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M1 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\nRouter> show version \nCisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), Version 15.0(1)M1, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc1)\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\nCopyright (c) 1986-2009 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\nCompiled Wed 02-Dec-09 17:17 by prod_rel_team\r\n!--- output truncated \r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in \"White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide\" at http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"]. \r\n\n\r\n\n",

				"text": "The Device Sensor feature of Cisco IOS Software is used to gather raw endpoint data from network devices that are using protocols such as Cisco Discovery Protocol, Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), and DHCP. The endpoint data is available to registered clients in the context of an access session.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a single DHCP packet to or through an affected device, causing the device to reload.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Device Sensor feature, enabled by default, is vulnerable on devices that have at least one interface with an IP address. The vulnerability is triggered when the Device Sensor feature attempts to process a DHCP packet. In affected releases, valid DHCP packets could trigger this vulnerability. \n\r\n\n\r\nFor more information about the Device Sensor feature, please refer to the Device Sensor Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/15.0_1_se/device_sensor/guide/sensor_guide.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability was previously documented in Cisco bug ID CSCty96049[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty96049\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2012-4621.\n\r\n\n",

				"text": "In affected releases, the Device Sensor feature is enabled by default. It is possible to mitigate the vulnerability in this advisory by applying the global configuration command device-sensor filter-spec dhcp exclude all. This command will filter the Device Sensor feature collection of DHCP packets, and the Device Sensor feature will no longer process or store DHCP information.  \n\r\n\n\r\nIn the following example, the global configuration command is issued:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSwitch# configure terminal\r\nSwitch(config)# device-sensor filter-spec dhcp exclude all\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nTo confirm that the Device Sensor feature is no longer collecting DHCP data, issue the show device-sensor cache all command. No DHCP entries should be present in the table.  \n\r\n\n\r\nIn the following example, the following table contains only Cisco Discover Protocol data:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nSwitch# show device-sensor cache all\r\nDevice: 000f.f7a7.234f on port GigabitEthernet2/1\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\nProto Type:Name Len Value\r\ncdp 22:mgmt-address-type 8 00 16 00 08 00 00 00 00\r\ncdp 19:cos-type 5 00 13 00 05 00\r\ncdp 18:trust-type 5 00 12 00 05 00\r\ncdp 11:duplex-type 5 00 0B 00 05 01\r\ncdp 10:native-vlan-type 6 00 0A 00 06 00 01\r\ncdp 9:vtp-mgmt-domain-type 9 00 09 00 09 63 69 73 63 6F\r\n",
