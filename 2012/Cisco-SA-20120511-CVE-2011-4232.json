The attacker could use this information to launch further attacks.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to access trusted, internal networks.  This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\r\n",
