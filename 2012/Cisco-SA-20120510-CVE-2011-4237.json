				"text": "Cisco Prime LAN Management Solution versions prior to 4.2 contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary code and conduct HTTP response-splitting attacks on a targeted system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly sanitizes user-supplied input while handling HTTP headers.  An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link.  If successful, the attacker could conduct carriage return-line feed (CRLF) injection and HTTP response-splitting attacks against the user.\r\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability and released updated software.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\r\n",
