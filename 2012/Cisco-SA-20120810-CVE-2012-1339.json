				"text": "Cisco Unified Computing System contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the improper handling of user-supplied SSH requests by affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by transmitting a crafted SSH request to the software. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to cause the abnormal termination of the application, resulting in a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed this vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need access to an internal, private network to submit crafted SSH requests. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
