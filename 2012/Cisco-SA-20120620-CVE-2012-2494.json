An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to view a malicious website. If successful, the attacker could cause the affected software to download and install an older version of the software.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security advisory and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.",
