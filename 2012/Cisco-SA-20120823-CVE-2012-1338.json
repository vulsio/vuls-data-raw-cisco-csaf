An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious authentication requests to the affected software. Successful exploitation could cause a DoS condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, authentication is required, and an attacker may require access to networks adjacent to a targeted device. These requirements increase the difficulty of exploitation.",
