An exploit could allow the attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted packets to a targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
