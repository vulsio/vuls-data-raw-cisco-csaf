An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted URL.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerabilities in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.",
