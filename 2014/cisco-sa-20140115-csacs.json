The presence of an additional  digit after the version number indicates the highest patch level installed. For  example, a version number of 5.1.0.44.3 indicates Cisco Secure  ACS version 5.1 with up to patch 3 installed. The absence of any additional  digit after the version string indicates a Cisco Secure ACS version with no  patches installed. The example above shows a Cisco Secure ACS running version 5.1 Patch 6.",

				"text": "A core component of the Cisco TrustSec solution, Cisco Secure ACS is a highly sophisticated policy platform providing RADIUS and TACACS+ services. It supports the increasingly complex policies needed to meet today's new demands for access control management and compliance. Cisco Secure ACS provides central management of access policies for device administration and wireless, wired 802.1x, and remote VPN network access scenarios. The identity stores can be internal or external. An internal identity store has user credential information stored in an internal database. With an external identity store, Cisco Secure ACS will retrieve information from an external database.\r\n\r\nCisco Secure ACS RMI Privilege Escalation Vulernability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the RMI interface of Cisco Secure ACS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform actions as superadmin.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the ACS via the RMI interface using an authenticated user account. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform superadmin functions via RMI.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud75180 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud75180\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0649.\r\n\r\nCisco Secure ACS RMI Unauthenticated User Access Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the RMI interface of Cisco Secure Access Control System (ACS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the ACS via the RMI interface.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication and authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the ACS via the RMI interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to access the ACS and perform administrative actions.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud75187 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud75187\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0648.\r\n\r\nThe RMI interface transports data over TCP port 2020 and TCP port 2030. The RMI interface is utilized for communication between Cisco ACS nodes in a distributed deployment environment.\r\n\r\nCisco Secure ACS Operating System Command Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Secure ACS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject operating system-level commands.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting operating system commands into a specific location of the ACS web interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform operating system-level commands without shell access, impacting the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue65962 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue65962\"] (registered [\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0650.",
