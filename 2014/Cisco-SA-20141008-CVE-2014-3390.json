An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected system as administrator, copying a malicious script onto the disk, and executing the script.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security advisory and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must log in locally to the affected device with administrative privileges. The required privileges greatly reduce the potential for exploitation.",
