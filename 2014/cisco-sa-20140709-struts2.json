				"text": "Multiple Cisco products include an implementation of the Apache Struts 2  component that is affected by a remote command execution vulnerability identified by Apache with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ID CVE-2010-1870.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization on user-supplied input in the XWorks component of the affected software. The component uses the ParameterInterceptors directive to parse the Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) expressions that are implemented via a whitelist feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests  that contain OGNL expressions to an affected system. An  exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability  for all the affected products except Cisco Business Edition 3000 Series. Customers using Cisco  Business Edition 3000 Series should contact their Cisco representative for  available options.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
