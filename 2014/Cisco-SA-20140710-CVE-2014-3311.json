An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a\r\nmodified Cisco WebEx Meetings client. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the remote computer or\r\ncause a denial of service (DoS) condition by crashing the remote Cisco WebEx Meetings client.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may attempt to convince a targeted user to download a malformed file with the Cisco WebEx Meetings client by using misleading language and instructions.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
