				"text": "A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the integrity and availability of the affected system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to validate user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs including SQL statements. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity and availability of some functions.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to an affected device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
