An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a malicious link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco would like to thank Adi Volkovitz from Check Point Security Research Team for reporting this vulnerability.",
