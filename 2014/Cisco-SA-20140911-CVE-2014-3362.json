An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating several management session requests.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must determine whether the Telnet service is running on a targeted device.\n\r\n\n\r\nAll MXP products have reached end of life (EOL) and end of software support (EoSW). Customer are advised to review the EOL/EoSW support notice at the following link: End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco TelePresence System Edge 75/95 MXP[\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/collaboration-endpoints/telepresence-system-edge-mxp-series/end_of_life_notice_c51-720894.html\"]",
