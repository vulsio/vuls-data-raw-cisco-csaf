An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by spoofing an XML external entity.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must spoof an XML external entity on the targeted device. It is likely that the device would reside on trusted, internal networks that the attacker may need to access. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
