				"text": "Issues in the cryptographic implementation of Cisco Intelligent Automation for Cloud (Cisco IAC) may allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to recover cryptographic material used in all Cisco IAC installations.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe issues are due to the inclusion of fixed cryptographic material in the product binaries. An attacker that could gain access to encrypted information from any Cisco IAC installation may be able to decrypt it using the recovered cryptographic material.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed these issues in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to access a targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the possibility of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
