They deliver highly secure, broadband, wired, and wireless connectivity to multiple offices and remote employees.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nCisco RV Series Routers Command Injection Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the network diagnostics administration pages of the Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the devices.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh87126[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh87126\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2177.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nCisco RV Series Routers HTTP Referer Header Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the administrative web interface of the Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user who is authenticated to the device to click a malicious link. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform actions in the administrative web pages of the device with the privileges of the authenticated user.\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh87145[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh87145\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2178.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco RV Series Routers Insecure File Upload VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the file upload routines of the Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations on the devices.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to upload files to an arbitrary location on the device.\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh86998[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh86998\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2179.\n\r\n\n",

This will result in loss of management connectivity to the device. Disabling this feature prevents Cisco QuickVPN access.\n\r\n\n\r\nRemote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled, administrators can disable it using the Web Access screen: Administration > Management Interface > Web Access. Check the box for Disabled in the Remote Management field.\n\r\n\n\r\nDisabling remote management helps ensure that only users on the LAN could attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nLimit Remote Management Access to Specific IP Addresses\n\r\n\n\r\nIf remote management is required, harden the device so that it can be accessed only by certain IP addresses, rather than the default setting of any. By accessing the configuration screen (Administration > Management Interface > Web Access), an administrator can change the Remote IP address field to ensure only devices with the specified IP addresses can access the device.\r\n\n",
