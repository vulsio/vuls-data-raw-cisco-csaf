Cisco has confirmed the undocumented test interface has been completely removed by the firmware images listed in this advisory and cannot be re-enabled in the Cisco WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point, Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router, and the Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Router.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link: \n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140110-sbd[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140110-sbd\"]",

This vulnerability can be triggered from the LAN interfaces of the Cisco WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router and the Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Router from the wireless LAN (WLAN) and the LAN interfaces of the Cisco WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an undocumented test interface in the TCP service listening on port 32764 of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the affected device from the LAN-side interface and issuing arbitrary commands in the underlying operating system. An exploit could allow the attacker to access user credentials for the administrator account of the device, and read the device configuration.  The exploit can also allow the attacker to issue arbitrary commands on the device with escalated privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCum37566[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum37566\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for the Cisco WAP4410N Wireless-N Access Point; Cisco bug IDs CSCum43693[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum43693\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and CSCum43700[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum43700\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for the WRVS4400N Wireless-N Gigabit Security Router; and Cisco bug ID CSCum43685[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum43685\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for the Cisco RVS4000 4-port Gigabit Security Router.
