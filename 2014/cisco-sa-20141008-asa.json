				"text": "Cisco ASA SQL*NET Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if SQL*Net inspection is enabled.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether SQL*Net inspection is enabled, use the show service-policy | include sqlnet command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with SQL*Net inspection enabled:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show service-policy | include sqlnet\r\nInspect: sqlnet, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: SQL*Net inspection is enabled by default.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the system is configured to terminate IKEv1 and IKEv2 VPN connections. This includes LAN-to-LAN, Remote Access VPN both via the IPSec VPN client and IKEv2 AnyConnect VPN, and L2TP over IPSec VPN connections. Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPNs are not affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine if the Cisco ASA is configured to terminate IKEv1 or IKEv2 VPN connections, a crypto map should be configured for at least one interface. Administrators should use the show running-config crypto map | include interface command and verify that it returns output. The following example shows a crypto map called cmap configured on the outside interface:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config crypto map | include interface\r\ncrypto map outside_map interface outside\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: IKEv1 or IKEv2 VPN are not configured by default.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA IKEv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the system is configured to terminate IKEv2 VPN connections. This includes LAN-to-LAN IKEv2 and AnyConnect IKEv2 VPN connections. To determine whether IKEv2 VPN is enabled use the show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enable command and verify that the command returns output. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with IKEv2 VPN enabled on the interface outside:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config crypto ikev2 | include enable\r\ncrypto ikev2 enable outside\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to having IKEv2 enabled, the Cisco ASA needs to have a crypto map configured on the interface where IKEv2 is enabled. This can be determined by using the show running-config crypto map | include interface command and verifying that it returns output. The following example shows a crypto map called cmap configured on the outside interface:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config crypto map | include interface\r\ncrypto map outside_map interface outside\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: IKEv2 VPN is not enabled by default.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Health and Performance Monitor Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if health and performance monitoring (HPM) for ASDM is enabled.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether HPM is enabled, use the show running-config | include hpm command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with the HPM feature enabled:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config | include hpm\r\nciscoasa# hpm topn enable\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: HPM is not enabled by default. \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA GPRS Tunneling Protocol Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) inspection is enabled.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether GTP inspection is enabled, use the show service-policy | include gtp command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with GTP inspection enabled:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show service-policy | include gtp\r\nInspect: gtp, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: GTP inspection is not enabled by default.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA SunRPC Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if SunRPC inspection is enabled.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether SunRPC inspection is enabled, use the show service-policy | include sunrpc command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with SunRPC inspection enabled:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show service-policy | include sunrpc\r\nInspect: sunrpc, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: SunRPC inspection is enabled by default.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA DNS Inspection Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if DNS inspection is enabled.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether DNS inspection is enabled, use the show service-policy | include dns command and verify that an output is returned. The following example shows the Cisco ASA Software with DNS inspection enabled:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show service-policy | include dns\r\nInspect: dns preset_dns_map, packet 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0, v6-fail-close 0\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: DNS inspection is enabled by default.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the system is configured to terminate any type of VPN connections, except Clientless SSL VPN, and it is configured in high availability (HA) mode (also known as failover mode).\n\r\n\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show running-config crypto map | include interface command to verify if any type of IKEv1 or IKEv2 IPSec VPNs are configured on the system and the show running-config webvpn | include anyconnect command to verify if AnyConnect SSL VPN is configured. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with both IPSec and AnyConnect SSL VPNs configured:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config webvpn | include anyconnect enable\r\n anyconnect enable\r\nciscoasa# show run crypto map | include interface\r\n crypto map outside_map interface outside\r\n\r\n\r\nAdministrators can use the show failover command and verify that the failover is ON to determine if high availability mode is configured. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with high availability mode enabled:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show failover\r\nFailover On\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability affects only HA configurations that do not use a failover key to protect failover traffic. HA and VPN are not enabled by default. \n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA VNMC Command Input Validation Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nAll Cisco ASA running an affected version of software are affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Local Path Inclusion Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nAll Cisco ASA running an affected version of software are affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\n Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Information Disclosure and Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the Clientless SSL VPN portal is enabled. To determine whether the Clientless SSL VPN portal is enabled use the show running-config webvpn command and verify that webvpn is enabled on at least one interface. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with the Clientless SSL VPN portal enabled on the outside interface:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config webvpn \r\nwebvpn\r\n enable outside\r\n [...]\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The Clientless SSL VPN portal is not enabled by default.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the following conditions are met:\r\n\r\n    Clientless SSL VPN portal functionality is enabled\r\n    A default customization object or a newly created customization object for Clientless SSL VPN portal has to be previewed in ASDM\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the Clientless SSL VPN portal is enabled use the show running-config webvpn command and verify that webvpn is enabled at least on one interface. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with the Clientless SSL VPN portal enabled on the outside interface:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config webvpn \r\nwebvpn\r\n enable outside\r\n [...]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no method to determine if a preview of a customization object has been done. The following method is used to preview a customization object. In ASDM navigate to CLIENTLESS SSL VPN ACCESS -> PORTAL -> CUSTOMIZATION -> PREVIEW. \n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional Indicator of Compromise for Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability\n\r\nCustomers running a vulnerable configuration should verify that the portal customization has not been compromised. Customers can verify that the portal has not been compromised by exporting the customization objects and manually verifying that the objects do not include malicious code.\n\r\n\n\r\n The new custom object and default customization object (DfltCustomization) should be analyzed. To export an SSL VPN portal customization object, use the export webvpn customization   command, where the  is the name of the SSL VPN portal customization object being exported and  is the name of the file that will include a copy of the customization object.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows how to export the default customization object DfltCustomization to a file called Customization_to_verify\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# export webvpn customization DfltCustomization Customization_to_verify\r\n\r\nThe Customization_to_verify file is stored on the device disk and can be exported for further analysis.\n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers should repeat this process for all of the customization objects that are present on the system.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the Smart Call Home (SCH) feature is configured or has been configured on the system. When the feature is configured, a digital certificate trustpoint called _SmartCallHome_ServerCA is automatically installed on the system. To determine whether this trustpoint is installed, use the show running-config crypto ca trustpoint _SmartCallHome_ServerCA command and verify that it returns output. The following example shows a Cisco ASA with this trustpoint installed:\r\n\r\nciscoasa# show running-config crypto ca trustpoint _SmartCallHome_ServerCA\r\ncrypto ca trustpoint _SmartCallHome_ServerCA\r\n crl configure\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The presence of this trustpoint would make the system vulnerable; however, this vulnerability cannot be exploited unless there is another feature configured that relies on digital certificates validation services. Examples of these features are digital certificate authentication for VPN or ASDM connections or TLS-Proxy and Phone-proxy. SCH is not enabled by default.",

An exploit could allow the attacker to\r\nbypass Clientless SSL VPN authentication and modify the portal content.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects only systems configured in routed firewall mode and only in single context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A valid TCP handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCup36829[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCup36829\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-3393.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco ASA Smart Call Home Digital Certificate Validation Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the\r\nSmart Call Home (SCH) feature of Cisco ASA Software could allow an\r\nunauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass digital certificate validation if any feature that uses digital certificates is configured on the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability exists because when SCH is configured, a\r\ntrustpoint, including a VeriSign certificate, is automatically installed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by presenting a valid\r\ncertificate signed by VeriSign when authenticating to the affected\r\nsystem. An exploit could allow the attacker, for example, to bypass digital\r\ncertificate authentication when used by a given feature. Examples of\r\nfeatures that could be configured to use digital certificates validation include\r\nVPN and Adaptive Security Device Management (ASDM) authentication, TLS Proxy, and Phone Proxy.\n\n\r\nNote: Only traffic directed to the affected system can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects both routed and transparent firewall mode in both single and multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. A valid TCP handshake is required to exploit this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCun10916[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun10916\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-3394.",

In order to eliminate the trustpoint, the administrator should use the no crypto ca trustpoint  command. The following example shows how to remove the trustpoint enabled by the SCH feature. Removing this trustpoint will cause SCH to stop working correctly.\r\n\r\nciscoasa(config)# no crypto ca trustpoint _SmartCallHome_ServerCA\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability, configuring a failover key would provide a workaround for this issue. To configure a failover key, use the failover key  command. The following example shows how to configure a failover key named cisco-key:\r\n\r\nciscoasa(config)#failover key cisco-key\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The use of the failover ipsec command will not provide a workaround to this issue.",

While upgrading to a fixed version of Cisco ASA Software prevents this vulnerability from being exploited further, it will not modify any customization objects that have already been compromised and are present on the system. If an attacker has already compromised a customization object, the compromised object will stay persistent after the upgrade.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo verify whether a customization object has been compromised, follow the instruction in \"Additional Indicator of Compromise for Cisco ASA Clientless SSL VPN Portal Customization Integrity Vulnerability\" that are included in the \"Vulnerable Products\" section of this advisory.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following method can be used to restore the default customization object (DfltCustomization):\n\r\n\r\n    Export the default template to a file. The following example shows how to export the default template to a file called default_template\r\n    \r\n    ciscoasa# export webvpn customization Template default_template\r\n    \r\n    Import the default template as default customization object (DfltCustomization):\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoasa# import webvpn customization DfltCustomization default_template\r\nNote: This will override any changes done to the default customization object (DfltCustomization). It is not possible to remove the default customization object (DfltCustomization) from the system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe import webvpn customization command can also be used to restore non-default customization objects after these have been manually edited and verified. It is possible to remove any non-default customization object by using ASDM and navigating to CLIENTLESS SSL VPN ACCESS -> PORTAL -> CUSTOMIZATION. In the CUSTOMIZATION panel, select the non-default customization objects and click on Delete.\n\r\n\r\nSoftware Download\r\nCisco ASA Software can be downloaded from the Software Center on Cisco.com by visiting http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/cisco/software/navigator.html\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nFor Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances and Cisco ASA 5500-X Next Generation Firewall navigate to Products\r\n> Security > Firewalls > Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA)\r\n> Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances >  > Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software. Please note that some of these versions are interim versions and can be found by expanding the Interim tab on the download page.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor the Cisco ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers, navigate to Products\r\n> Cisco Interfaces and Modules > Cisco Services Modules >\r\nCisco Catalyst 6500 Series / 7600 Series ASA Services Module >\r\nAdaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software. Please note that some of these versions are interim versions and can be found by expanding the Interim tab on the download page.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall, navigate to Products\r\n> Security > Firewalls > Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA)\r\n> Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall > Adaptive Security Appliance\r\n(ASA) Software.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor the Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv), navigate to Products\r\n> Security > Firewalls > Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA)\r\n> Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) > Adaptive Security Appliance\r\n(ASA) Software.\n",

In order to eliminate the trustpoint, the administrator should use the no crypto ca trustpoint  command. The following example shows how to remove the trustpoint enabled by the SCH feature. Removing this trustpoint will cause SCH to stop working correctly.\r\n\r\nciscoasa(config)# no crypto ca trustpoint _SmartCallHome_ServerCA\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability, configuring a failover key would provide a workaround for this issue. To configure a failover key, use the failover key  command. The following example shows how to configure a failover key named cisco-key:\r\n\r\nciscoasa(config)#failover key cisco-key\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The use of the failover ipsec command will not provide a workaround to this issue."

In order to eliminate the trustpoint, the administrator should use the no crypto ca trustpoint  command. The following example shows how to remove the trustpoint enabled by the SCH feature. Removing this trustpoint will cause SCH to stop working correctly.\r\n\r\nciscoasa(config)# no crypto ca trustpoint _SmartCallHome_ServerCA\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Cisco ASA VPN Failover Command Injection Vulnerability, configuring a failover key would provide a workaround for this issue. To configure a failover key, use the failover key  command. The following example shows how to configure a failover key named cisco-key:\r\n\r\nciscoasa(config)#failover key cisco-key\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The use of the failover ipsec command will not provide a workaround to this issue."
