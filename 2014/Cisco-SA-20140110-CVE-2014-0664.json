				"text": "A vulnerability in the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) function of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause 100 percent CPU utilization on the Cisco Unity Connection server, which may cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the processing of specific IMAP commands. \n\r\n\n\r\nAn attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specific IMAP commands to the Cisco Unity Connection server. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU utilization on the Cisco Unity Connection server.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement limits the possibility of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
