				"text": "A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN subsystem of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to process certain types of HTTP requests. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could submit crafted requests designed to consume memory to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to consume and fragment memory on the affected device. This may cause reduced performance, a failure of certain processes, or a restart of the affected device.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140326-ios-sslvpn[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140326-ios-sslvpn\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: The March 26, 2014, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the March 2014 bundled publication. \r\n\r\nIndividual publication links are in Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication at the following link: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar14.html[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_mar14.html\"]\r\n",

				"text": "Only devices that have been configured for the WebVPN Enhancements feature (Cisco IOS SSLVPN) are affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether a device is enabled for WebVPN, the preferred method is to issue the show webvpn gateway EXEC command. A device is affected if it is running the vulnerable software and the configuration lists the Admin and Operation statuses of any configured gateway as up.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn the following example, the device has a single WebVPN gateway configured called ssl-vpn. The gateway is up and accepting connections\r\n\r\nRouter#show webvpn gateway\r\n\r\nGateway Name                       Admin  Operation\n------------                       -----  ---------\nssl-vpn                            up     up\r\n\r\nAdministrators may also perform a configuration check by issuing the following EXEC commands, show running-config | include webvpn. If the device returns any output this means that SSLVPN is configured on the device and the device may be vulnerable. If the output from show running-config | include webvpn contains webvpn gateway , then the device is configured to support the Cisco IOS SSLVPN feature. A device is vulnerable if it has the inservice command in at least one of the webvpn gateway sections. The following example shows a vulnerable device configured with Cisco IOS SSLVPN:\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config | include webvpn\r\n        \nwebvpn gateway ssl-vpn\n ip address 10.1.1.1 port 443  \n ssl trustpoint Gateway-TP\n inservice\n !\nRouter#\r\n\r\nA device that supports the Cisco IOS SSLVPN is not vulnerable if it does not have a WebVPN gateway configured or all the configured WebVPN gateway entries contain the no inservice sub-command within the webvpn gateway section.\r\n\n\r\nTo determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to \"Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software\" or \"Cisco IOS Software.\" The image name displays in parentheses, followed by \"Version\" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.\r\n\r\nThe following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter> show version \nCisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)\nTechnical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupport\nCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.\nCompiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team\r\n!--- output truncated \r\n\r\nAdditional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide[\"http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html\"]. \r\n",

				"text": "When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and  confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. \n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nIn February 2014, Cisco announced details of an industry-wide issue with memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. Although the majority of Cisco products that use these components are experiencing field failure rates below expected levels, a device reload or power cycle could expose component failures. While there are no known security implications associated with this issue, a subset of the affected products may experience a memory component failure during the software upgrade process. Cisco recommends customers review the related information and product-specific field notices at www.cisco.com/go/memory[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/memory\"] before making upgrade decisions. Each Field Notice indicates whether the product could experience the memory component failure during a software upgrade.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software\r\nThe Cisco IOS Software Checker[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x\"] is the quickest method to determine exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The tool allows customers to quickly identify Cisco Security Advisories that impact specific Cisco IOS Software releases. Users can initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from their local system. The tool is also capable of parsing show version command output. Results can be customized by searching against all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all the advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication. \n\r\n\n\r\nCustomers can also use the Cisco IOS Software tables below to determine their exposure. Each row corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software release; if a particular release is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the second column. The third column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all vulnerabilities in this Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n<!-- cisco-sa-20140326-sslvpn_VER_8 -->\r\n<!-- cisco-sa-20140326-sslvpn_OVERLAY_VER_6 -->\r\n<!-- Applied overlays : \r\ncisco-sa-20140326-sslvpn_OVERLAY_VER_6, -->\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n[\"javascript:Toggle(']Expand to View Detailed Fixed Software Information\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n             Major Release\r\n                 Availability of Repaired Releases\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Affected 12.0-Based Releases\r\n            First Fixed Release\r\n            First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            There are no affected 12.0 based releases\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Affected 12.2-Based Releases\r\n            First Fixed Release\r\n            First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            There are no affected 12.2-based releases\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Affected 12.3-Based Releases\r\n            First Fixed Release\r\n            First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            There are no affected 12.3 based releases\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Affected 12.4-Based Releases\r\n            First Fixed Release\r\n            First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            There are no affected 12.4 based releases\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Affected 15.0-Based Releases\r\n            First Fixed Release\r\n            First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            There are no affected 15.0 based releases\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Affected 15.1-Based Releases\r\n            First Fixed Release\r\n            First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication\r\n        \r\n        \r\n             15.1EY\r\n            Not vulnerable\n\r\n            \r\n            Vulnerable;
