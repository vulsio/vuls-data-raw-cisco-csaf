				"text": "A vulnerability in the CERUserServlet pages of the Cisco Emergency Responder (Cisco ER) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against the Cisco ER web interface.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections on the Cisco ER web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make changes to Cisco ER on behalf of the user.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
