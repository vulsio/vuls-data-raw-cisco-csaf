				"text": "A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) inspection engine code could allow an\r\nunauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a slow memory leak, which may cause\r\ninstability on the affected system. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper\r\nhandling of SIP packets inspected by the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) SIP inspection engine. An\r\nattacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP packets\r\nthrough the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause\r\nallocated memory not to be returned during the attack. This may cause system\r\ninstability and a partial denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted SIP packets through a targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the possibility of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
