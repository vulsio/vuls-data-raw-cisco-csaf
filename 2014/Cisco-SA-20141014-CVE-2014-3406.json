				"text": "A vulnerability in the IP logging feature of Cisco Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Software could allow\r\nan unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected\r\nsystem.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a race condition when\r\nwriting the IP logging file. An attacker could exploit this\r\nvulnerability by sending traffic through the sensor that would hit the rule configured with the IP logging feature.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, the IP logging feature must be configured on a targeted device, and the attacker may need to acquire additional information about whether this feature is enabled. In addition, the attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside to send traffic to hit the rule configured with the IP logging feature.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
