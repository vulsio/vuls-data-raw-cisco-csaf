An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious SharePoint application. An exploit could allow the attacker to crash the application optimization handler and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the WAAS appliance.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140521-waas[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140521-waas\"]",

This option is disabled by default.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Only Cisco WAAS software releases 5.1.1 through 5.1.1.d are affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether the SharePoint prefetch option has been enabled do one of the following:\n\r\n\n\r\nCheck the output of sh run | include prefetch. If the command returns as shown in the following example, the prefetch option is enabled:\r\n\r\nwaas_lab#sh run | include prefetch\r\naccelerator http sharepoint-opt prefetch enable\r\n\r\n\n\r\nCheck the output of the show accelerator http command and look for the SharePoint Prefetch line. The following output example demonstrates a system that has enabled the SharePoint Accelerator:\r\n\r\nwaas_lab#show accelerator http\r\n\r\nAccelerator    \tLicensed       \tConfig State   \tOperational State\r\n-----------    \t--------       \t------------   \t-----------------\r\nhttp           \tYes            \tEnabled        \tRunning\r\n\r\nHTTP:\r\n   Accelerator Config Item            Mode        Value\r\n   -----------------------            ----        ------\r\n   Suppress Server Encoding           Default     Disabled\r\n[...]\r\n   Sharepoint Prefetch                User        Enabled\r\n[...]\r\n",

				"text": "Cisco WAAS application acceleration and WAN optimization solutions accelerate the performance of any TCP-based application delivered across a WAN, providing the benefits of branch-office data consolidation and acceleration of centralized applications.\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the SharePoint prefetch optimization code of Cisco WAAS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the optimization process to crash and may allow arbitrary execution code on the affected system.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate certain types of requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to connect to a malicious SharePoint installation that could supply a malformed response to a user request that is optimized by an affected device. A successful attack could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with elevated privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Only Cisco WAAS software that is specifically configured with SharePoint prefetch optimization is affected by this vulnerability. This option is disabled by default.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue18479[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue18479\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2196.",
