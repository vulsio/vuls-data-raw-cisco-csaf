				"text": "The Cisco IPS is a family of network security devices that provide\r\nnetwork-based threat prevention services. Cisco IPS Software includes\r\nseveral applications that are used by the system to run different tasks.\r\nIn particular, the MainApp process is responsible for multiple\r\ncritical tasks, including reading the configuration, starting and\r\nstopping applications, and authentication service, while the Analysis Engine process is responsible for the analysis and inspection of traffic passing through the sensor.\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional information about the MainApp and Analysis Engine processes is in the \"System Architecture\" section of the product configuration guide:\n\r\nhttp://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/ips/7.1/configuration/guide/idm/idm_system_architecture.html#wp1126061[\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/ips/7.1/configuration/guide/idm/idm_system_architecture.html#wp1126061\"]\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the produce-verbose-alert code of Cisco Intrusion\r\nPrevention System (IPS) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote\r\nattacker to cause the Analysis Engine process to become unresponsive.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability is due to improper handling of fragmented packets by the\r\nAnalysis Engine process when the produce-verbose-alert action is enabled. An\r\nattacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending fragmented packets\r\nthrough the affected system. To trigger the vulnerability, the\r\nattacker could cause a signature with the produce-verbose-alert action to\r\nfire, or trigger an event for which produce-verbose-alert has been configured as an event action override. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process\r\nto become unresponsive. This will cause the affected system to stop inspecting\r\ntraffic.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability can be triggered by IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) fragmented packets\r\npassing through the affected system. Traffic directed to the management\r\nIP address of the Cisco IPS will not trigger this\r\nvulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCui91266[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui91266\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-0718.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the implementation of the control-plane access list\r\nof the Cisco IPS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote\r\nattacker to cause the MainApp process to become unresponsive.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle malformed TCP packets sent to the\r\nmanagement IP address of the affected system. An attacker could exploit\r\nthis vulnerability by sending crafted TCP packets to TCP port 7000 of the IP address of the management interface.\r\nAn exploit could allow the attacker to make the MainApp process\r\nunresponsive. This creates a denial of service (DoS) condition because\r\nthe Cisco IPS sensor is not able to execute several critical tasks\r\nincluding alert notification, event store management, and sensor\r\nauthentication. The Cisco IPS web server will also be unavailable while\r\nthe MainApp process is unresponsive. Additionally, due to this general\r\nsystem failure, other processes such as the Analysis Engine may not work\r\nproperly.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability can be triggered only by TCP traffic directed to\r\nTCP port 7000 of the IP address of the management interface. Traffic passing through the sensing interfaces\r\nwill not trigger this vulnerability. If the Cisco IPS is configured in\r\npromiscuous mode, mitigation actions that require MainApp processing such as shun or rate-limit\r\nmay be unavailable. If the Cisco IPS is configured in inline mode, the\r\nsensor may not correctly perform inspection and mitigation actions\r\nbecause the Analysis Engine process may not work properly.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability affects only Cisco IPS Software running on hardware and software module for Cisco ASA 5500 Series and Cisco ASA 5500-X Series.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCui67394[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui67394\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0719.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in Cisco IPS code that handles jumbo frames  could allow an\r\nunauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process\r\nto become unresponsive.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper\r\nhandling of jumbo frames sent a high rate. An attacker could exploit\r\nthis vulnerability by sending jumbo frames through the sensing interface\r\nof the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Analysis Engine process\r\nto become unresponsive. This will cause the affected system to stop inspecting\r\ntraffic.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 based jumbo frames\r\npassing through the affected system. Traffic directed to the management\r\nIP address of the Cisco IPS will not trigger this\r\nvulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh94944[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh94944\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-0720.",

				"text": "To work around the Cisco IPS Analysis Engine Denial of Service Vulnerability administrator can disable the produce-verbose-alert action.\n\r\n\n\r\nUse show configuration command to determine which signature has the produce-verbose-alert option enabled or wheter the produce-verbose-alert option is enabled as EAO.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf the produce-verbose-alert has been configured at the signature level, the value can be modified by entering the signature configuration prompt and modifying the event action for each signature that needs modification to use produce-alert instead of the produce-verbose-alert action. The following example shows the procedure to change the event action from produce-verbose-alert to produce-alert for signature 1475/0:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nsensor(config)# service signature-definition sig0\nsensor(config-sig)# signatures 1475 0 \nsensor(config-sig-sig)# engine string-tcp \nsensor(config-sig-sig-str)# event-action produce-alert\nsensor(config-sig-sig-str)# exit\nsensor(config-sig-sig)# exit\nsensor(config-sig)# exit\nApply Changes?[yes]: yes\nsensor(config)#\r\n\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, an administrator can use the Cisco Intrusion Prevention System Device Manager (IDM) to\r\nconnect to the Cisco IPS and navigate to Configuration > Policies\r\n> Signature Definitions >  -Sig-Definition-Name- > Active\r\nSignatures and filter by using Filter: Action Produce Verbose Alert in order to verify any active signatures with the produce-verbose-alert option enabled.\n\r\n\n\r\nFor each of the signatures, right-click and choose Edit Action. From the panel, uncheck the Produce Verbose Alert check box, click the OK and apply the changes.\n\r\n\n\r\nIf the produce-verbose-alert action is enabled as EAO, this can be disable by modifying the settings for the event action rules policy.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows how to disable the override with produce-verbose-alert configured in the rules0 event action rules policy:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nsensor(config)# service event-action-rules rules0\nsensor(config-eve)# no overrides produce-verbose-alert \nsensor(config-eve)# exit\nApply Changes?[yes]: yes\nsensor(config)# \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThere is no workaround for the Cisco IPS Control-Plane MainApp Denial of Service Vulnerability , however restricting the number of allowed hosts may reduce the exposure of this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo restrict the number of allowed hosts, the administrator should use the access-list command. The no access-list command should be used to remove any hosts or networks from the list.\n\r\nThe following example shows the sequence of commands to remove\r\naccess to the full 192.168.1.0/24 network and allow access only to the\r\nhost with IP address 192.168.1.1:\r\n\r\n    Use the show settings command in\r\n    network-setting configuration mode to see the current allowed hosts or\r\n    networks. The following example shows that the Cisco IDSM-2 is\r\n    configured to allow all the hosts in the 192.168.1.0/24 network:\r\n\r\n\r\nsensor(config-hos-net)# show settings\n   network-settings\n   -----------------------------------------------\n      [...]\n      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)\n      -----------------------------------------------\n         network-address: 192.168.1.0/24\n         -----------------------------------------------\n      -----------------------------------------------\n      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds \n      login-banner-text: \n      [...]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Use the access-list command in network-setting\r\n    configuration mode to add the 192.168.1.1 hosts.\r\n\r\nNote: make sure that if this\r\nis the only allowed host, it is also the one from which you are\r\nexecuting the configuration commands to avoid losing connectivity to the Cisco\r\nIDSM-2 Module.\r\n\r\nsensor(config-hos-net)#access-list 192.168.1.1/32\r\n\r\n\r\n    Use the no access-list command in network-setting configuration mode to remove the 192.168.1.0/32 network for the allowed hosts list:\r\n\r\n\r\nsensor(config-hos-net)#no access-list 192.168.1.0/24\r\n\r\n\r\n    Use the show settings command in network-setting configuration mode to check that the list of allowed hosts is correct:\r\n\r\n\r\nsensor(config-hos-net)# show settings\n   network-settings\n   -----------------------------------------------\n      [...]\n      access-list (min: 0, max: 512, current: 1)\n      -----------------------------------------------\n         network-address: 192.168.1.1/32\n         -----------------------------------------------\n      -----------------------------------------------\n      ftp-timeout: 300 seconds \n      login-banner-text: \n      [...]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Exit and apply the configuration:\r\n\r\n\r\nsensor(config-hos-net)# exit\nsensor(config-hos)# exit\nApply Changes:?[yes]: \r\n\n\r\nThere is no workaround for the Cisco IPS Jumbo Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAdditional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the\r\nnetwork are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion\r\ndocument for this Advisory: http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=32605 [\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=32605\"]\n",
