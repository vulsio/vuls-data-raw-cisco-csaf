An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\r\ninjecting crafted packets in the Q.931 flow. An successful exploit could allow\r\nthe attacker to trigger a drop of the D-channel. As a result, all active calls handled by the affected\r\nsystem will be terminated and it will not be possible to establish new calls until the D-channel\r\ncommunication is restored. A software reload is necessary to restore normal behavior.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug IDÂ  CSCui50360[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui50360\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-0660.",
