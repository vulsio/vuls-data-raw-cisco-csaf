Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140319-asyncos[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140319-asyncos\"]",

				"category": "general",
				"text": "All models of\r\nCisco ESA and Cisco SMA running a vulnerable version of Cisco IronPort\r\nAsyncOS Software or Cisco AsyncOS Software are affected by the vulnerability described in this security advisory.\n\r\n\n\r\nIn order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to enable the FTP service and Safelist/Blocklist (SLBL) service on the affected system, rely on the fact that these services are already enabled or convince the system administrator to at least temporarily enable them. \n\r\n\n\r\nNote: The two services do not have to be enabled at the same time in order for the attack to succeed.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether the FTP service is actively listening for new connections use the netstat command from the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cisco ESA or Cisco SMA and verify that TCP port 21 is in the LISTEN state.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following example shows a Cisco ESA with the FTP service active (in the LISTEN state):\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nciscoesa> netstat\n\nChoose the information you want to display:\n1. List of active sockets.\n2. State of network interfaces.\n3. Contents of routing tables.\n4. Size of the listen queues.\n5. Packet traffic information.\n[1]> \n\n1. IPv4 only.\n2. IPv6 only.\n[1]> \n\nShow network addresses as numbers? [N]> y\n\nAvoid truncating addresses? [N]> \n\nActive Internet connections (including servers)\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address       (state)\ntcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.443      *.*                    LISTEN\ntcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.80       *.*                    LISTEN\ntcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.25       *.*                    LISTEN\ntcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.21       *.*                    LISTEN\r\n\n\r\nNote: TCP port 21 is the default port for the FTP service; however, this is configurable at the time the service is activated. Customer should review all open ports to determine whether the FTP service has been enabled on a different port.\n\r\nThe FTP service may be enabled by default on some version of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA and Cisco SMA.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether the SLBL service is enabled, use the slblconfig command. The following example shows a Cisco ESA with the SLBL service enabled.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nciscoesa> slblconfig\nEnd-User Safelist/Blocklist: Enabled\n[...] \r\nNote: The SLBL service is not enabled by default.\n\r\nDetermining the Running Software Version\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS\r\nSoftware is running on a Cisco ESA, administrators can issue the version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software version 7.6.2-201:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscoesa> version\nCurrent Version\n===============\nProduct: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) Appliance\nModel: X1070\nVersion: 7.6.2-201\n[...]\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS\r\nSoftware is running on an Cisco Content SMA, administrators can issue the version command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software version 7.9.1-039:\r\n\r\n\r\nciscosma> version\nCurrent Version\n===============\nProduct: Cisco IronPort M670 Security Management(tm) Appliance\nModel: M670\nVersion: 7.9.1-039\r\n",

The tampered file could contain\r\nshell code that would be executed by the affected system when a specific\r\nevent is triggered (for example, when a new email is received that\r\ntriggers the SLBL check). To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have the FTP and SLBL services enabled, at least temporarily, and have valid credentials to upload the tampered\r\nSLBL database file via FTP. \n\r\n\n\r\nAn exploit could allow the attacker to execute\r\narbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the root\r\nuser.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID CSCug79377[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug79377\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco ESA and CSCug80118[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug80118\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) for Cisco Content SMA.
