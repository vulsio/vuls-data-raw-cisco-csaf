				"text": "Multiple SIP Denial of Service Vulnerabilities\n\r\n\n\r\nMultiple vulnerabilities in the SIP\r\ncode of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an\r\nunauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected system to become\r\nunresponsive and reload.\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to improper\r\nhandling of crafted or malformed SIP packets. An attacker could exploit\r\nthis vulnerability by sending the crafted packets to the affected\r\nsystem.\n\r\n\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities can be triggered by SIP messages sent via UDP or\r\nTCP. Messages sent via Transport Layer Security (TLS) will also be affected.\r\nThe default ports for UDP and TCP deployments are UDP port 5060 and TCP\r\nport 5060. The default port for TLS deployment is TCP port 5061.\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs CSCud29566[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud29566\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only), CSCua64961[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua64961\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only), CSCuj94651[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuj94651\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only), CSCtq72699[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq72699\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only), CSCto70562[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto70562\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only), and CSCua86589[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua86589\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only).\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities have been assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs: CVE-2014-2162, CVE-2014-2163, CVE-2014-2164, CVE-2014-2165, CVE-2014-2166 and CVE-2014-2167.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence TC and TE Software DNS Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the implementation of the DNS code of Cisco\r\nTelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote\r\nattacker to create a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary\r\ncode.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds check on variables. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability\r\nby injecting crafted DNS response packets.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCty44804[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty44804\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2168.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Input Validation Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the implementation of internal system scripts of the Cisco\r\nTelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an authenticated, remote\r\nattacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with the\r\nprivilege of the root user.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the improper\r\nvalidation of parameters passed to the affected system scripts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing\r\narbitrary commands as arguments to the affected scripts.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue60211[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue60211\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2169.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence TC and TE Software tshell Command Injection Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the implementation of several system scripts of Cisco\r\nTelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an authenticated, remote\r\nattacker to inject arbitrary commands with the privileges of the root user\r\nvia tshell (tcsh).\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to the improper\r\nimplementation of the code in several scripts that can be executed on\r\nthe affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\r\npassing arbitrary commands while executing the affected scripts.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCue60202[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue60202\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only)  and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2170.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Heap Overflow Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the SIP code\r\nof Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an unauthenticated,\r\nremote attacker to create a heap overflow condition. This condition could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the affected system to reload.\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted SIP packets. An\r\nattacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP packets\r\nto the affected system. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be triggered by SIP messages sent via UDP or\r\nTCP. Messages sent via Transport Layer Security (TLS) will also be affected.\r\nThe default ports for UDP and TCP deployments are UDP port 5060 and TCP\r\nport 5060. The default port for TLS deployment is TCP port 5061.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCud81796[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud81796\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2171.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence TC and TE Software U-Boot Buffer Overflow Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the\r\nimplementation of executable utilities that use the universal bootloader\r\n(u-boot) compiler of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow\r\nan authenticated, local attacker to create a buffer overflow and\r\npossibly execute arbitrary code on the affected system.\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability is due to the improper implementation of internal executable files\r\nwhen the u-boot compiler flag is defined. An attacker could exploit\r\nthis vulnerability by accessing the affected system command-line interface (CLI) and try to run\r\nthe affected executable files. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub67693[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub67693\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2172.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Unauthenticated Serial Port Access Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the\r\nauthentication code of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow\r\nan unauthenticated, local attacker to connect to the serial port and obtain privileged access to the affected system.\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to\r\nthe improper implementation of authentication and authorization controls for the serial port. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\r\nconnecting to the affected port and run a series of commands. \n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCub67692[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub67692\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2173.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco TelePresence TC H.225 Denial of Service Vulnerability\n\r\n\n\r\nA vulnerability in the H.225 code of Cisco TelePresence TC Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the\r\naffected system to exhaust the available memory and to reload.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability is due to the improper handling of crafted or malformed H.225\r\npackets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending\r\ncrafted packets to the affected system. \r\n\r\n \n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCtq78849[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq78849\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2175.",
