Only Trident-based line cards on Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers are affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient logic in parsing malformed IPv6 packets.

An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of an NP chip and a line card, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. \n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\n\r\nhttp://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140611-ipv6[\"http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140611-ipv6\"]",

The device does not have to be configured with IPv6 to be affected by this vulnerability.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe first generation of the Cisco ASR 9000 Series Ethernet line cards are referred to as Trident-based line cards. The term comes from the NPs that are used on these line cards.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following line cards are Trident based:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    A9K-40GE-L\r\n    A9K-40GE-B\r\n    A9K-40GE-E\r\n    A9K-4T-L\r\n    A9K-4T-B\r\n    A9K-4T-E\r\n    A9K-8T/4-L\r\n    A9K-8T/4-B\r\n    A9K-8T/4-E\r\n    A9K-2T20GE-L\r\n    A9K-2T20GE-B\r\n    A9K-2T20GE-E\r\n    A9K-8T-L\r\n    A9K-8T-B\r\n    A9K-8T-E\r\n    A9K-16T/8-B\r\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether the line card on an ASR 9000 Series Router is Trident based, the administrator can use the show diag command. Affected devices will include the PID for at least one of the Trident-based cards.
