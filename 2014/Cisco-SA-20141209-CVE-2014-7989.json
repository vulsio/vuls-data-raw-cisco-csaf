An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command in the command-line interface.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may need local system access to the targeted system under the local-mgmt context. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
