				"text": "The vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx WRF Player and the Cisco WebEx ARF Player. The following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27, WBS28 and WBS29), Cisco WebEx 11, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server are affected by at least one of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\n\r\n\r\n    Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS29) client builds prior to T29.2\r\n    Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS28) client builds prior to T28.12\r\n    Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27) client builds prior to T27LDSP32EP16 (27.32.16) \r\n    Cisco WebEx 11 versions prior to 1.2.10 with client builds prior to T28.12\r\n    Cisco WebEx Meetings Server client builds prior to 2.0.0.1677\r\n\r\n\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support > Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under \"About Support Center.\" See \"Software Versions and Fixes\" for details.\n\r\n\n\r\nAlternatively, version information of the Cisco WebEx Meeting client can be accessed from within the Cisco WebEx Meeting client. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Windows and Linux platforms can be viewed by choosing Help > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center. Version information for the Cisco WebEx meeting client on Mac platforms can be viewed by choosing Meeting Center > About Cisco WebEx Meeting Center.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.16 is fixed, build 27.32.17 will contain updated software; Cisco WebEx site administrators have access to secondary version nomenclature, for example, T27 SP32 EP16. The example shows the server is running client build 27.32.16.\n\r\n\n\r\nNote: Customers who do not receive automatic software updates may be running versions of Cisco WebEx that have reached end of software maintenance and should contact customer support.",

				"text": "The Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS) meeting services and Cisco WebEx 11 are hosted multimedia conferencing solutions that are managed and maintained by Cisco WebEx. The Cisco WebEx Meetings Server is a multimedia conferencing solution that customers can host in their private clouds.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe ARF and WRF file formats are used to store WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site, or on the computer of an online meeting attendee.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx ARF Player and the Cisco WebEx WRF Player are applications that are used to play back and edit WebEx ARF and WRF recording files (files with .arf and .wrf extensions).\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx WRF Player and Cisco WebEx ARF Player can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site (for stream playback mode). The Cisco WebEx ARF Player and the Cisco WebEx WRF Player can also be manually installed after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html to play back recording files for offline playback.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe Cisco WebEx ARF Player is available for all Cisco WebEx meeting site clients (WBS27, WBS28 and WebEx11) and for Cisco WebEx Meetings Server clients. The Cisco WebEx WRF Player is only available for Cisco WebEx WBS 27 and WBS28 meeting site clients and is not available for the Cisco WebEx 11 or Cisco WebEx Meetings Server clients.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following table provides the Cisco bug IDs and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers that have been assigned for the vulnerabilities in this advisory:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            Title \r\n            CVE ID \r\n            Cisco Bug IDs \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx WRF and ARF Player Out of Bound Memory Read Vulnerability \r\n            CVE-2014-2132\r\n            CSCuh52768 \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx ARF Player LZW Decompress Memory Corruption Vulnerability \r\n            CVE-2014-2133 \r\n            CSCuj87565 \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx Player WRF File Audio Channel Parsing Heap Overflow Vulnerability\r\n            CVE-2014-2134\r\n            CSCuc39458 \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx ARF Players Memory Corruption Vulnerability \r\n            CVE-2014-2135 \r\n            CSCul87216, CSCuj07603 \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cisco WebEx ARF Players Memory Corruption Vulnerability\r\n            CVE-2014-2136\r\n            CSCui72223, CSCul01163, CSCul01166 \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nExploitation of these vulnerabilities may cause player applications to crash or, in some cases, remote code execution could occur.\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit one of these vulnerabilities, the player applications would need to open a malicious ARF or WRF file. An attacker may be able to accomplish this exploit by providing the malicious recording file directly to users (for example, by using email), or by directing a user to a malicious web page. The vulnerabilities cannot be triggered by users who are attending a WebEx meeting.\n\r\n\n",

				"text": "When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt[\"http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution. \r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. \n\r\n\n\r\nThe following client builds of Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27, WBS28, WBS29) and Cisco WebEx 11 correct the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\n\r\n\r\n    Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS29) client builds T29.2 or later \r\n    Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS28) client builds T28.12 or later \r\n    Cisco WebEx Business Suite (WBS27) client builds T27TLSP32EP16 (27.32.16) or later \r\n    Cisco WebEx 11 version 1.2.10 with client builds T28.12 or later \r\n    Cisco WebEx Meetings Server client builds 2.0.0.1677 or later \r\n\r\nClient builds of the Cisco WebEx Business Suite prior to T27 SP32 have reached end of support; to obtain fixed software please upgrade to the latest version.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe following client builds of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server correct the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:\n\r\n\r\n    Cisco WebEx Meetings Server client builds Orion 2.0 or later \r\n\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco WebEx meeting site is running an affected version of the WebEx client build, users can log in to their Cisco WebEx meeting site and go to the Support > Downloads section. The version of the WebEx client build will be displayed on the right side of the page under \"About Support Center.\" See \"Software Versions and Fixes\" for details. The Cisco WebEx software updates are cumulative in client builds. For example, if client build 27.32.16 is fixed, build 27.32.17 will contain updated software.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities disclosed in this advisory affect the Cisco WebEx WRF and ARF Players. The Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the players are all affected by at least one vulnerability described in this advisory. If the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was automatically installed, it will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html[\"http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html\"].\n\r\n\n\r\nUsers can manually verify the installed version of the Cisco WebEx ARF Player or the Cisco WebEx WRF Player to determine whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities. To do so, an administrator must examine the version numbers of the installed files and determine whether the version of the file contains the fixed code. Detailed instructions on how to verify the version numbers are provided in the following sections.\n\r\n\n\r\nMicrosoft Windows\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\nTen dynamic link libraries (DLLs) were updated on the Microsoft Windows platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. These files are in the C:\\Program Files\\WebEx\\Record Playback folder or the C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Webex\\Record Player folder. The version number of a DLL can be obtained by browsing the Record Playback directory in Windows Explorer, right-clicking the filename, and choosing Properties. The Version or Details tab of the Properties page provides details about the library version. The following table provides the first fixed version for each DLL. If the installed versions are equal to or greater than the versions provided in the table, the system is not vulnerable.\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Client Build\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Cisco DLL Filename\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            DLL File Versions\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T28\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atas32.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            28, 0800, 0012, 1105\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T28\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Atjpeg60.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2028,1208,1100,500\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T28\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atas32_lite.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            28, 0800, 0112, 1105\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T28\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atdl2006.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            1028, 1208, 1100, 0500\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T28\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atpdmod.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T28\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            nbrpd.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T28\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atprtses.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T28\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atprtsc.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2028.1208.1100.2300\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T27LDSP32EP16\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atjpg60.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            1027,1232,1016,2200\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T27LDSP32EP16\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atas32.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            1027,1232,1016,2200\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T27LDSP32EP16\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            Atas32_Lite.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            1027,1232,1016,2201\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T27LDSP32EP16\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atdl2006.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            1027,1232,1016,2300\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T27LDSP32EP16\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atpdmod.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2029.1232.1116.2300\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T27LDSP32EP16\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            nbrpd.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2029.1232.1116.2300\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T27LDSP32EP16\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atprtses.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2029.1232.1116.2300\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T27LDSP32EP16\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            atprtsc.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2029.1232.1116.2300\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            T29L10N\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            nbrpse.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2029.1311.900.1100\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            \r\n            Orion2.0.0.FCS\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            nbrpse.dll\r\n\r\n            \r\n            \r\n            2029.1332.1200.600\r\n\r\n            \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nApple Mac OS X\n\r\n\n\r\nSix package bundles were updated on the Apple Mac OS platform to address the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.
