An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by\r\nsending crafted URLs that include SQL statements. An exploit could allow\r\nthe attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the\r\ndatabase.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nAlthough Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that software updates are not available, software updates are available for Cisco bug ID CSCum05313.
