				"text": "A vulnerability in the\r\nimplementation of executable utilities that use the universal bootloader\r\n(u-boot) compiler of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow\r\nan authenticated, local attacker to create a buffer overflow and\r\npossibly execute arbitrary code on the affected system.\n\r\n\r\nThe\r\nvulnerability is due to the improper implementation of internal executable files\r\nwhen the u-boot compiler flag is defined. An attacker could exploit\r\nthis vulnerability by accessing the affected system command-line interface (CLI) and try to run\r\nthe affected executable files. \n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security advisory and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nA successful exploit would require local access to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
