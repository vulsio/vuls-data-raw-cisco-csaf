				"text": "Cisco Integrated Management Controller SSH Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (Cisco IMC) SSH module of the Cisco Unified Computing System E-Series Blade servers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to properly handle an SSH packet that contains specific values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted packet to the SSH server running on the Cisco IMC of an affected device. If successful, the Cisco IMC of the device may become unresponsive and cannot be restarted from the IOS command line interface or via IPMI.\n\r\n\n\r\nRecovery of the Cisco IMC will likely require a restart of the affected E-Series Server via physical interaction with the blade's power switch, or a restart of the ISR G2 router that the device is installed in. A restart of the E-Series blades via the power switch will cause a loss of power to the operating system running on the device. A restart of the ISR G2 router will cause a loss of all traffic passing through the router while it restarts as well as impacting the blade servers installed in the device. Cisco recommends utilizing an OS provided remote access method to properly shutdown the operating system to prevent potential corruption of the OS before preforming any recovery action if available.\n\r\n\n\r\nBoth the SSH CLI and Web GUI services are enabled by default once the IP Address for the device has been configured either manually or via DHCP.\n\r\n\n\r\nThis vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuo69206[\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuo69206\"] (registered[\"http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do\"] customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-3348.",
