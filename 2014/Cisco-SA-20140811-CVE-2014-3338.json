				"text": "A vulnerability in the CTIManager module of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.\n\r\n\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate input contained within Kerberos single sign-on (SSO) tokens. This vulnerability is only exposed when the Cisco CTIManager is enabled and single sign-on has been configured.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have authenticated access to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.",
