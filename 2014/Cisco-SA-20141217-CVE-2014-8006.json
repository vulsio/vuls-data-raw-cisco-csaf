An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to access the device via telnet during the disaster recovery mode period of execution. An exploit could allow the attacker to obtain access to the device via unauthenticated telnet.\n\r\n\n\r\nFunctional code that exploits this vulnerability is publicly available.\n\r\n\n\r\nCisco has confirmed the vulnerability but updated software is not available.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may need to have access to trusted or internal networks to be able to connect to the targeted system. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.",
