In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20127: Cisco Prime Infrastructure Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view privileged information about network devices that are managed by an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of sensitive data in the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the interface as a low-privileged user and taking certain actions within the configuration pages of the network devices. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive information about the network devices that is stored on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc25461 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc25461\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20127\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20131: Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM XSS Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface of an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc76734 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc76734\"], CSCwd28312 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd28312\"], CSCwd69561 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd69561\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20131\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20129: Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco EPNM could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view certain files from the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive files on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
