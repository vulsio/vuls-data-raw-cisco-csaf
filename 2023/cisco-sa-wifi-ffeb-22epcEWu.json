				"text": "On March 27, 2023, the research paper Framing Frames: Bypassing Wi-Fi Encryption by Manipulating Transmit Queues was made public. This paper discusses vulnerabilities in the 802.11 standard that could allow an attacker to spoof a targeted wireless client and redirect frames that are present in the transmit queues in an access point to an attacker-controlled device. This attack is seen as an opportunistic attack and the information gained by the attacker would be of minimal value in a securely configured network.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "To reduce the probability that the attacks that are outlined in the paper will succeed, Cisco recommends using policy enforcement mechanisms through a system like Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE), which can restrict network access by implementing Cisco TrustSec or Software Defined Access (SDA) technologies. Cisco also recommends implementing transport layer security to encrypt data in transit whenever possible because it would render the acquired data unusable by the attacker.",
