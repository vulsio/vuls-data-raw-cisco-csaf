This release is a Limited Deployment (LD) release. Customers who wish to upgrade to this release can contact Cisco TAC to provision this release to their appliances. The General Deployment (GD) release is currently under review and will be available in the future.\r\n2. For customers using Cisco Secure Email Cloud Gateway, no action is required. Cisco has taken actions to protect the infrastructure from this vulnerability, and upgrades to fixed releases will be deployed as part of the standard upgrade processes for the environment.\r\nIn most cases, the software can be upgraded over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the web interface of the appliance. To upgrade a device by using the web interface, do the following:\r\n\r\nChoose System Administration > System Upgrade.\r\nClick Upgrade Options.\r\nChoose Download and Install.\r\nChoose the release to upgrade to.\r\nIn the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.\r\nClick Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
