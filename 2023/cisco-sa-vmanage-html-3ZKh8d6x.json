An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting malicious content within requests and persuading a user to view a page that contains injected content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify pages within the web-based management interface, possibly leading to further browser-based attacks against users of the application.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
