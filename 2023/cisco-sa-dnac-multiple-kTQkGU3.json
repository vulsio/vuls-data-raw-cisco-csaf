In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20182: Cisco DNA Center Software API Command Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the API of Cisco DNA Center Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands in a restricted container as the root user.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in API request parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary commands that would then be executed in a restricted container with root privileges.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nIn Cisco DNA Center Software releases 2.2.3.4 and earlier, low privileges are sufficient for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability.\r\nIn Cisco DNA Center Software releases 2.2.3.5 and later, only users with NETWORK-ADMIN-ROLE or SUPER-ADMIN-ROLE can exploit this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd58359 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd58359\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20182\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20183: Cisco DNA Center Software API User Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the API of Cisco DNA Center Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to enumerate limited user information.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper authorization of API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to enumerate limited information of users configured on the device. This information does not include passwords or password hashes.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd59863 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd59863\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20183\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20184: Cisco DNA Center Software API Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the API of Cisco DNA Center Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with low privileges to read information from a restricted container.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper authorization of API requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read information from a restricted container that would normally be accessible only to high-privileged users.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
