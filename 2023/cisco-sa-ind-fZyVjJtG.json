In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20037: Cisco Industrial Network Director Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in Cisco IND could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct stored XSS attacks.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of content that is submitted to the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious HTTPS requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc29356 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc29356\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20037\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20038: Cisco Industrial Network Director Static Private Key Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the monitoring application of Cisco IND could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access a static private key that is used to encrypt both local data and credentials for accessing remote systems.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because a static key value that is stored in the application can be used to encrypt application data and remote credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining local access to the server on which Cisco IND is installed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt local data or access remote systems monitored by Cisco IND.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc29341 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc29341\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20038\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in this section.\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20037\r\n        Cisco IND Release  First Fixed Release          1  1.7.0\r\nCVE-2023-20038\r\n        Cisco IND Release  First Fixed Release          1  1.6.0\r\nNote: Releases earlier than Release 1.10.0 are no longer available for download from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/\"] on Cisco.com. To obtain fixed software, please upgrade to the latest version.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
