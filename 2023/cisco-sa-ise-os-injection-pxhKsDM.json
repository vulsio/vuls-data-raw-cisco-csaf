To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must have valid Administrator privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by submitting a crafted CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.
