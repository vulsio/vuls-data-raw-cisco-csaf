An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to to obtain sensitive data, including hashed credentials for services associated to the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary network requests sourced from the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco plans to release software updates that address this vulnerability.
