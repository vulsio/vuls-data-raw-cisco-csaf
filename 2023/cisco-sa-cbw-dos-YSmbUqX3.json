An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing multiple wireless clients to attempt to connect to an access point (AP) on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reboot after a significant amount of time, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
