				"text": "On January 18, 2023, Cisco disclosed the following:\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the URL filtering mechanism of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the URL reputation filters on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper processing of URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a URL in a particular way. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the URL reputation filters that are configured for an affected device, which could allow malicious URLs to pass through the device.\r\nAfter additional investigation, it was determined that this vulnerability is not exploitable. For more information, see the Workarounds [\"#wa\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\n",

It is also recommended that all positive verdicts be either dropped or quarantined.\r\n\r\nWhile this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations.
