An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and modify data that is handled by an internal service on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu\"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in this section.\r\n        Cisco DNA Center Release  First Fixed Release          2.3.31 and earlier   Migrate to a fixed release.      2.3.4  Migrate to a fixed release.      2.3.5  2.3.5.4      2.3.6  Migrate to a fixed release.      2.3.7  Not affected.\r\n1. Cisco DNA Center Software Release 2.3.3 has reached End of Software Maintenance [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-listing.html\"]. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\nCisco DNA Center is a dedicated physical appliance that is purchased from Cisco with the Cisco DNA Center ISO image pre-installed. System updates are available for installation from the Cisco cloud and are not available for download from the Software Download Center on Cisco.com. To upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco DNA Center Software, use the Software Updates feature of the software. For more information, see the Cisco DNA Center Upgrade Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/network-automation-and-management/dna-center/upgrade/b_cisco_catalyst_center_upgrade_guide.html\"].\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
