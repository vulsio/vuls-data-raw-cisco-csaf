In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNote: These vulnerabilities can be exploited only by valid and authorized users of Cisco ISE. As a best practice, customers can restrict console access and admin web access. To configure access restrictions, choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Settings > Access > IP Access.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20193: Cisco ISE Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Embedded Service Router (ESR) of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read, write, or delete arbitrary files on the underlying operating system and escalate their privileges to root. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid Administrator-level privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper privilege management in the ESR console. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges to root and read, write, or delete arbitrary files from the underlying operating system of the affected device.\r\n\r\nNote: The ESR is not enabled by default and must be licensed. To verify the status of the ESR in the Admin GUI, choose Administration > Settings > Protocols > IPSec.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd07348 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd07348\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20193\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.0\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20194: Cisco ISE Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the ERS API of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid Administrator-level privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper privilege management in the ERS API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate their privileges beyond the sphere of their intended access level, which would allow them to obtain sensitive information from the underlying operating system .\r\n\r\nNote: The ERS is not enabled by default. To verify the status of the ERS API in the Admin GUI, choose Administration > Settings > API Settings > API Service Settings.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd93721 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd93721\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20194\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.9\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N",
