The paper discusses two attacks that can cause VPN clients to leak traffic outside the protected VPN tunnel. In both instances, an attacker can manipulate routing exceptions that are maintained by the client to redirect traffic to a device that they control without the benefit of the VPN tunnel encryption.\r\n\r\n",

As a result, clients in a default configuration are not affected by the LocalNet attacks.\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-36673\r\n\r\nFor the ServerIP attacks, customers who use the Umbrella Roaming Security module are protected against DNS spoofing attacks like the one described by CVE-2023-36673.",

For example, customers who need to allow access to printers on a client local LAN can enable Client Firewall for Local Printer Support, as outlined in the General VPN Setup chapter of the ASDM Book 3: Cisco ASA Series VPN ASDM Configuration Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa915/asdm715/vpn/asdm-715-vpn-config/vpn-asdm-setup.html#ID-2188-000002c3__ID-2188-000002e5\"]. Similar firewall rules can be created for other local services that require access.\r\n\r\nFor customers who have not deployed the Umbrella Roaming Security Module, more information is available in the AnyConnect OpenDNS Roaming Security Module Deployment Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client/200940-Anyconnect-OpenDNS-Roaming-Security-Modu.html#anc18\"].",
