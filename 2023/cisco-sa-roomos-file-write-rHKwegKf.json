An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a series of crafted commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID: CSCwc85883 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc85883\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20090\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20091: Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Arbitrary File Overwrite Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local file system of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files that are on the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have a remote support user account.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID: CSCwc71178 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc71178\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20091\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20004, CVE-2023-20092, and CVE-2023-20093: Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Arbitrary File Overwrite Vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nThree vulnerabilities in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local file system of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to improper access controls on files that are on the local file system. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have a remote support user account.\r\n\r\nNote: CVE-2023-20092 does not affect Cisco DX70, DX80, TelePresence MX Series, or TelePresence SX Series devices.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds read that discloses sensitive information.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability only affects Cisco Webex Desk Hub.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID: CSCwb86296 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb86296\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20094\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N",
