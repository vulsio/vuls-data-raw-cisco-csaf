In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNote: These vulnerabilities can be exploited only by valid and authorized users of the Cisco ISE system. As a best practice, customers can restrict console access and admin web access. To configure the access restrictions, choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Settings > Access > IP Access.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20166: Cisco ISE Path Traversal Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a path traversal attack to escape the restricted shell and gain root privileges on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of parameters that are sent by a certain CLI command within the restricted shell. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to a device and issuing a certain crafted CLI command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and gain root privileges on the underlying operating system of the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be an authenticated shell user.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd07350 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd07350\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20166\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.0\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20167: Cisco ISE Path Traversal Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid Administrator level privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files of specific types from the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwe17953 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe17953\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20167\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.9\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N",
