In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nNote: These vulnerabilities can be exploited only by valid and authorized users of the Cisco ISE system. As a best practice, customers can restrict console access and admin web access. To configure the access restrictions, choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Settings > Access > IP Access.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20171: Cisco Identity Services Engine Arbitrary File Deletion Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to delete arbitrary files on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains certain character sequences to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete specific files that their configured administrative level should not have access to.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd38138 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd38138\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20171\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20106: Cisco Identity Services Engine Authorization Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass the authorization mechanisms for specific file management functions.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the lack of server-side validation of Administrator permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to either download or delete certain files that should be restricted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid read-only Administrator credentials.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd63674 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd63674\"], CSCwc86067 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc86067\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20106\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20172: Cisco Identity Services Engine Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device.
