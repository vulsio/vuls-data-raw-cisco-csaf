An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an AP on an affected device as a wireless client and sending a high rate of traffic over an extended period of time. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Datagram TLS (DTLS) session to tear down and reset, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nAt the time of publication, the release information in the following table was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n\r\nThe left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe process to upgrade an AP requires administrators to upgrade the wireless controller to which the AP is registered. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table.\r\n        Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controller Software Release  First Fixed Release           16.12 and earlier  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.6  17.6.6      17.7  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.8  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.9  Not vulnerable.\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
