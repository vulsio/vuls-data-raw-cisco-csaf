An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass an ACL on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 2023 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

				"text": "At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and had MPLS packet filtering enabled with the explicit-null or de-aggregation label on the ingress direction:\r\n\r\nIOS XR White box (IOSXRWBD)\r\nNetwork Convergence Series (NCS) 540 Series Routers\r\nNCS 560 Series Routers\r\nNCS 5500 Series\r\nNCS 5700 Series\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n\r\nDetermine Whether Filtering of MPLS Packets on the Ingress Direction is Enabled\r\n\r\nTo determine whether filtering of MPLS packets on the ingress direction is enabled, follow this two-step process:\r\n\r\nIdentify all MPLS interfaces.\r\nCheck the configuration to see if an IPv4 or IPv6 ACL is configured for the ingress direction.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows an MPLS interface TenGigE0/0/0/0 that has both an IPv4 and an IPv6 ACL configured on the ingress direction. In the show mpls interfaces, if the Enabled column has a Yes present, then MPLS is enabled on that interlace:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS5501-1##show mpls interfaces\r\nThu Mar 16 02:47:56.142 UTC\r\nInterface                  LDP      Tunnel   Static   Enabled\r\n-------------------------- -------- -------- -------- --------\r\nTenGigE0/0/0/0             No       No       No       Yes\r\nTenGigE0/0/0/1             No       No       No       Yes\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS5501-1#\r\n\r\n\r\nThe device is affected by this vulnerability if any of the interfaces in the preceding example have either an IPv4 or IPv6 ingress ACL applied, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS5501-1#show run interface TenGigE0/0/0/0\r\n!\r\ninterface TenGigE0/0/0/0\r\n description ** Example where IPv4 and IPv6 ACL ingress applied **\r\n ipv4 address 192.168.12.1 255.255.255.0\r\n ipv4 access-group CVE-2023-20191 ingress\r\nipv6 access-group CVE-2023-20191 ingress\r\n!\r\nRP/0/RP0/CPU0:NCS5501-1#\r\n\r\nIP ingress ACL filtering on MPLS interfaces is not currently supported on any other Cisco IOS XR Platforms.",

			{
				"category": "general",
				"text": "Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass protections that are provided by an ACL that is applied on an affected device. The overall impact of exploitation is organization-specific because it depends on the importance of the assets that the ACL was supposed to protect. Customers should evaluate how exploitation of this vulnerability would impact their network and proceed according to their own vulnerability-handling and remediation processes.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because filtering of MPLS packets with the explicit-null or de-aggregation label on the ingress direction is not supported on any Cisco IOS XR platforms. However, support was added for products listed in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory. When the affected device receives the labeled packet and pops the label, it then attempts to process the configured ingress ACL. If an ACL deny entry is hit, the packet is punted to generate an ICMP unreachable packet that is to be returned. Rather than dropping the packet, this path then forwards the denied packet to the destination.",

				"text": "There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCustomers could remove the ingress ACLs from the MPLS-enabled interfaces and use egress ACLs in their environment. Egress hybrid ACLs are supported in Cisco IOS XR releases 7.6.2 and later.\r\n\r\nWhile this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.",
