An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwf04956 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf04956\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20181\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20218: Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones HTML Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business SPA500 Series IP Phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify a web page in the context of a user's browser.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the contents of a web page to redirect a user to potentially malicious websites. A successful exploit could also allow the attacker to conduct further client-side attacks.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwf82071 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf82071\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20218\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N",
