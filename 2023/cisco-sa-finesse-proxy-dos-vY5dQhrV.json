				"text": "A vulnerability in the nginx configurations that are provided as part of the VPN-less reverse proxy for Cisco Finesse could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition for new and existing users who are connected through a load balancer.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper IP address filtering by the reverse proxy. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of unauthenticated requests to the reverse proxy. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all current traffic and subsequent requests to the reverse proxy through a load balancer to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n\r\nAt the time of publication, the release information in the following table was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n\r\nThe left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability that is described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n        Cisco Finesse Release  First Fixed Release          Earlier than 12.6(1) ES7  12.6(1) ES7\r\nIn addition to installing the fixed release, the following configurations must be applied to the reverse proxy and on any intermediary devices such as load balancers:\r\n\r\nIntermediary network devices that are front-ending the reverse proxy, such as load balancers, should be exempted from configurations that are meant for rate limiting and blocking unauthorized access to avoid blocking the reverse proxy IP address instead of the unauthorized user IP addresses. To configure these devices correctly, follow Step 1 in the Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise Features Guide, Release 12.6(1) - Reverse-Proxy Configuration [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/icm_enterprise/icm_enterprise_12_6_1/configuration/guide/ucce_b_features-guide-1261/appendix.html\"].\r\nIntermediary network devices that are front-ending the reverse proxy, such as load balancers, should be enabled with the capability to allow requests to contain the user IP addresses instead of the IP addresses of the intermediary devices. To configure these devices correctly, follow Steps 2 and 3 in the Cisco Unified Contact Center Enterprise Features Guide, Release 12.6(1) - Reverse-Proxy Configuration [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/icm_enterprise/icm_enterprise_12_6_1/configuration/guide/ucce_b_features-guide-1261/appendix.html\"].\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
