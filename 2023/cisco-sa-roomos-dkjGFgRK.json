In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20002: Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Software SSRF Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to bypass access controls and conduct an SSRF attack through an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to a user of the web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary network requests that are sourced from the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc85914 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc85914\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20002\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20008: Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Software Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence CE and RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the local system of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper access controls on files that are in the local file system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a symbolic link in a specific location on the local file system of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device.\r\n\r\nNote: This vulnerability does not affect Cisco DX70, DX80, TelePresence MX Series or TelePresence SX Series devices.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc47201 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc47201\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20008\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N",
