An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted DMG file to be scanned by ClamAV on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to leak bytes from any file that may be read by the ClamAV scanning process.\r\n\r\nFor a description of this vulnerability, see the ClamAV blog [\"https://blog.clamav.net/\"].\r\n\r\n",
