				"text": "A vulnerability in the bidirectional forwarding detection (BFD) hardware offload feature of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers, ASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers, and ASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a line card to reset, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of malformed BFD packets that are received on line cards where the BFD hardware offload feature is enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv4 BFD packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause line card exceptions or a hard reset, resulting in loss of traffic over that line card while the line card reloads.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bfd-XmRescbT\"]/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bfd-XmRescbT [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bfd-XmRescbT\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the March 2023 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

				"text": "This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR 64-bit Software and have BFD hardware offload enabled for any of the installed line cards:\r\n\r\nASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers only if they have a Lightspeed or Lightspeed-Plus-based line card installed\r\nASR 9902 Compact High-Performance Routers\r\nASR 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determine Which Line Cards are Installed\r\nTo determine which line cards are installed in the device, use the show platform CLI command.\r\n\r\nCisco ASR 9902 and 9903 Compact High-Performance Routers integrate a Lightspeed-Plus-based line card.\r\n\r\nThe following line cards are Lightspeed-based:\r\n\r\nA9K-16X100GE-TR\r\nA99-16X100GE-X-SE\r\nA99-32X100GE-TR\r\n\r\nThe following line cards are Lightspeed-Plus-based:\r\n\r\nA9K-4HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA9K-4HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA9K-8HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA9K-8HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA9K-20HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA9K-20HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA99-4HG-FLEX-SE\r\nA99-4HG-FLEX-TR\r\nA99-10X400GE-X-SE\r\nA99-10X400GE-X-TR\r\nA99-32X100GE-X-SE\r\nA99-32X100GE-X-TR\r\n\r\nFor more information about line card type identification, see ASR 9000 Series Line Card Types [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/116726-qanda-product-00.html\"].\r\n\r\nNote: The Cisco Lightspeed-Plus list of product identifiers was accurate at the time of publication. For specific questions and further clarification about a product identifier, contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC).\r\n  Determine Whether BFD Hardware Offload is Enabled\r\nTo determine which line cards have BFD hardware offload enabled, use the show bfd hw-offload state CLI command. If the configuration and operational states are enabled on one of the previously mentioned line cards, the device is affected by this vulnerability. The following example shows a device in which BFD hardware offload is not enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#show bfd hw-offload state\r\nWed Mar 8 16:00:00.000 UTC  BFD HW OFFLOAD Feature state:  0/2/CPU0  -----------------  Configuration State:   Disabled  Operational   State:   Disabled  RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#\r\n\r\nThe following example shows a device in which BFD hardware offload is enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#show bfd hw-offload state\r\nWed Mar 8 16:00:00.000 UTC    BFD HW OFFLOAD Feature state:  0/2/CPU0  -----------------  Configuration State:  Enabled  Operational   State:  Enabled  RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#\r\n\r\nNot all BFD sessions are handled in hardware even if BFD hardware offload is enabled. At least one BFD session has to indicate H/W as Yes, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#show bfd all session\r\nWed Mar 8 16:00:00.000 UTC  IPv4:  -----  Interface  Dest Addr         Local det time(int*mult)      State\r\nEcho         Async   H/W   NPU  ---------- -------------   ------------ ----------------   ----------  ti100      10.0.0.1        0s(0s*0)     900ms(300ms*3)     UP\r\nNo    n/a\r\nHu0/2/0/15 192.168.100.100 0s(0s*0)     900ms(300ms*3)     UP\r\nYes   0/2/CPU0  RP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#",

Creating Infrastructure Access Control Lists (iACLs) is a mitigation that only limits the attack surface.\r\n\r\nDisable BFD Hardware Offload\r\n\r\nTo disable BFD hardware offload, remove any of the hw-module bfw-hw-offload enable commands and reset the assigned line card, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#config terminal\r\nWed Mar 8 16:00:00.000 UTC\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006(config)#no hw-module bfd-hw-offload enable location 0/2/CPU0\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006(config)#commit\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006(config)#end\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#hw-module subslot 0/2/CPU0 reload\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate Infrastructure Access Control Lists\r\n\r\nWhile iACLs limit the attack surface, they do not prevent exploitation from allowed peers and are subject to spoofing.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows an iACL that allows only infrastructure BFD peers (where 192.0.2.x/24 is the infrastructure address space):\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006# show running-config ipv4 access-list\r\nipv4 access-list BFD_DROP\r\n5 remark * Mark sure to Allow Legitimate BFD peers *\r\n 10 permit udp 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq bfd\r\n11 remark * Depending on BFD deployment may need *\r\n12 permit udp 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq 4784\r\n 13 permit udp 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq 6784\r\n15 remark * Drop all other attempts to the infrastructure address space *\r\n 20 deny udp any 192.0.2.0 0.0.0.255 eq bfd\r\n 30 permit ipv4 any any\r\n!\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006#\r\n\r\nApply this iACL to all exposed interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows an iACL that allows only BFD packets with a Time to Live (TTL) of 255 (expected for single hop sessions):\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/RSP0/CPU0:ASR9006# show running-config ipv4 access-list\r\nipv4 access-list BFD_DROP_TTL\r\n5 remark * Drop based purely on TTL.
