In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20009: Cisco ESA and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web UI and CLI of Cisco ESA and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker (web UI) or authenticated, local attacker (CLI) to elevate privileges to root. The attacker must have valid user credentials with Operator-level privileges or higher.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the improper validation of an uploaded Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) configuration file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and uploading a specially crafted SNMP configuration file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands as root.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd29901 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd29901\"], CSCwd29905 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd29905\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20009\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20075: Cisco ESA Command Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco ESA could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting operating system commands into a legitimate command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted command prompt and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system as the CLI process user. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid user credentials with Operator-level privileges or higher.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd50043 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd50043\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20075\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.0\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in the following tables:\r\n\r\nESA\r\n        Cisco AsyncOS Software Release  First Fixed Release for CVE-2023-20009  First Fixed Release for CVE-2023-20075          Earlier than 12.5  Migrate to a fixed release.

This release is for cloud-based products.\r\nIn most cases, the software can be upgraded over the network by using the System Upgrade options in the web interface of the appliance. To upgrade a device by using the web interface, do the following:\r\n\r\nChoose System Administration > System Upgrade.\r\nClick Upgrade Options.\r\nChoose Download and Install.\r\nChoose the release to upgrade to.\r\nIn the Upgrade Preparation area, choose the appropriate options.\r\nClick Proceed to begin the upgrade. A progress bar displays the status of the upgrade.\r\n\r\nAfter the upgrade is complete, the device reboots.\r\n\r\nCisco Cloud Email Security (CES) includes Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager devices as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
