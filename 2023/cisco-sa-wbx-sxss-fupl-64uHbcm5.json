An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link during the session. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwe38541 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe38541\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20132\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.4\r\nCVSS Vector:CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20134: Cisco Webex Meetings File Upload Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files as recordings.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTML request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to upload arbitrary files to Cisco Webex Meetings as recordings.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwe38537 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe38537\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20134\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\r\nCVSS Vector:CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N",
