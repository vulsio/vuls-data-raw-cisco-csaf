An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying objects in the PHP Agent install directory, which would run with the same privileges as PHP. A successful exploit could allow a lower-privileged attacker to elevate their privileges to root on an affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco AppDynamics has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
