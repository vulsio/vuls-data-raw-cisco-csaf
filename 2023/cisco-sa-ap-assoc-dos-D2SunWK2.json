An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a wireless 802.11 association request frame with crafted parameters to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following tables, the left column lists Cisco software releases. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by all the vulnerabilities described in this bundle of advisories and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nAPs Managed by Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) or Mobility Express (ME)\r\n           Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Software Release  First Fixed Release          8.8 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      8.9  Migrate to a fixed release.      8.10  8.10.171.0\r\nAPs Managed by Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controller or Embedded Wireless Controller (EWC)\r\n           Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controller Software Release  First Fixed Release          Earlier than 16.12  Not vulnerable.      16.12  16.12.8      17.1  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.2  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.3  17.3.5      17.4  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.5  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.6  17.6.3      17.7  Migrate to a fixed release.      17.8  Not vulnerable.      17.9  Not vulnerable.\r\nBusiness APs and Mesh Extenders\r\n           Cisco Business 150 AP and 151 Mesh Extender Software Release  First Fixed Release          10.2.2 and earlier  Migrate to a fixed release.      10.3.2  10.3.2.0\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
