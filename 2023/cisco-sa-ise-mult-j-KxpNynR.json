In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20272: Cisco ISE Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload malicious files to the web root of the application.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient file input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file to the web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to replace files and gain access to sensitive server-side information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc45768 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc45768\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20272\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20208: Cisco ISE XSS Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the web-based management interface of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid administrative credentials.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc45750 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc45750\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20208\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N",
