				"text": "A vulnerability in an API endpoint of multiple Cisco Unified Communications Products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization, which could impact access to the web-based management interface and cause delays with call processing. This API is not used for device management and is unlikely to be used in normal operations of the device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper API authentication and incomplete validation of the API request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to a specific API on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to high CPU utilization, which could negatively impact user traffic and management access. When the attack stops, the device will recover without manual intervention.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in the following tables:\r\n\r\nEmergency Responder: CSCwf62074 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf62074\"]\r\n           Cisco Emergency Responder Release  First Vulnerable Release  First Fixed Release          11.5(1) and earlier  Not vulnerable  Not vulnerable      12.5(1)  Not vulnerable  Not vulnerable      14  14SU3  ciscocm.cer_V14SU3_CSCwf62074.cop.sha512\r\nPrime Collaboration Deployment: CSCwf62080 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf62080\"]\r\n           Cisco Prime Collaboration Deployment Release  First Vulnerable Release  First Fixed Release          11.5(1) and earlier  Not vulnerable  Not vulnerable      12.5(1)  Not vulnerable  Not vulnerable      14  14SU3  ciscocm.V14SU3_pcd_CSCwf62080.k4.cop.sha512\r\nUnified CM Unified and CM SME:  CSCwf44755 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf44755\"]\r\n           Cisco Unified CM and Unified CM SME Release  First Vulnerable Release  First Fixed Release          11.5(1) and earlier  Not vulnerable  Not vulnerable      12.5(1)  12.5(1)SU7  12.5(1)SU8      14  14SU3  ciscocm.V14SU3_CSCwf44755.cop.sha512\r\nUnified CM IM&P: CSCwf62094 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf62094\"]\r\n           Cisco Unified CM IM&P Release  First Vulnerable Release  First Fixed Release          11.5(1) and earlier  Not vulnerable  Not vulnerable      12.5(1)  12.5(1)SU7   12.5(1)SU8      14  14SU3  ciscocm.cup_CSCwf62094_14SU3.cop.sha512\r\nUnity Connection: CSCwf62081 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf62081\"]\r\n           Cisco Unity Connection Release  First Vulnerable Release  First Fixed Release          11.5(1) and earlier  Not vulnerable  Not vulnerable      12.5(1)  Not vulnerable  Not vulnerable      14  14SU3  ciscocm.cuc.V14SU3_CSCwf62081-2.zip\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
