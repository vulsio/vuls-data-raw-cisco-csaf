				"text": "An issue with the boot-time programming of access control lists (ACLs) for Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow a device to boot without all of its ACLs being correctly installed.\r\n\r\nThis issue is due to a logic error that occurs when ACLs are programmed at boot time. If object groups are not in sequential order in the startup configuration, some access control entries (ACEs) may not be installed. Because ACLs govern network traffic to, from, and across the device, an incorrectly programmed ACL could cause traffic disruptions by blocking traffic that should be allowed or allowing traffic that should blocked. As a result, the device could have ACLs that are not properly programmed such that a range of both permit ACEs and deny ACEs could be missed, adversely affecting all traffic patterns.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this issue. There are no workarounds that address this issue.\r\n\r\n",

This behavior is not dependent on whether the object search ACL optimization feature is enabled.\r\n\r\nIf the object group configuration fails to load, the following error message will appear on the console when the device reloads:\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecified group object (name) does not exist\r\n*** Output from config line xxxx, \" group-object name...\"\r\n\r\nThis error message will not be present during subsequent reloads of the device.\r\n  Behavior in Releases That Are Affected by CSCwe64043 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe64043\"]\r\nIn Cisco ASA Software releases 9.18.3.39, 9.18.3.46, and 9.19.1.12 and Cisco FTD Software Release 7.2.4 with the OGS ACL optimization feature enabled, this issue would only be triggered when the device reloads.\r\n\r\nObject groups that are out of order in the startup configuration will load but are silently not applied to all ACL rules that are associated to a broader object group that uses them as a member.\r\n\r\nThis behavior only occurs if the OGS ACL optimization feature is enabled. This feature is enabled by default for new deployments of Cisco ASA Software releases 9.18.1 and later and Cisco FTD Software releases 7.2.0 and later. In earlier releases of Cisco ASA Software and Cisco FTD Software, this feature is disabled by default. When upgrading to a susceptible release, the previous configuration is retained. For additional details, see the Release Notes for the Cisco Secure Firewall ASA Series, 9.18(x) : New Features in ASA 9.18(1) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa918/release/notes/asarn918.html#reference_epy_jcy_35b\"].\r\n\r\nDetermine the OGS ACL Optimization Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine the OGS ACL optimization configuration, use the show running-config object-group-search command on the device CLI. The following example shows the output of the show running-config object-group-search command on a device that has the OGS ACL optimization feature enabled and thus is potentially at risk:\r\n\r\n\r\n# show running-config object-group-search\r\nobject-group-search access-control\r\n\r\nIf the command returns empty output or an output of no object-group-search access-control, the OGS ACL optimization feature is disabled and the device is not susceptible to the issue.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are susceptible, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.",

				"text": "ACLs govern network traffic to, from, and across the device. An incorrectly programmed ACL could cause traffic that should have been allowed to be blocked or traffic that should have been blocked to be allowed, potentially causing traffic disruptions. A device that is affected by the issue that is described in this advisory could be missing a range of both permit ACEs and deny ACEs, so all traffic patterns could be affected adversely.\r\n\r\nNote: There is no single configuration parameter or status that can be reviewed to determine if a device would experience this issue when rebooted. In general terms, the problem occurs when a broader object group references another object group that is not yet initialized. For example, object-group #1 uses object-group #2 as a member, but due to the sequential order of the startup configuration, object-group #2 will only be created later. This allows for the condition where ACEs may be missing upon reboot.\r\n  Behavior of Susceptible Configuration in Releases Not Affected by CSCwe64043 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe64043\"]\r\nThis issue can affect Cisco products if they are running Cisco ASA Software releases 9.18.1 or later or Cisco FTD Software releases 7.2.0 or later. For these releases, object groups that are out of order will fail to load from the startup configuration. In this example of a susceptible configuration, Object-group network group1-dmz is in the startup configuration after it is referenced. Therefore, Object-group network group1-dmz will not load and will be missing from the running configuration as a member of parent object-group network ���A���.\r\n\r\n\r\n!\r\nObject-group network group2-dmz\r\nObject-group network group3-dmz\r\n!\r\nobject-group network ���A���\r\n group-object group1-dmz\r\n group-object group2-dmz\r\n group-object group3-dmz\r\n!\r\nObject-group network group1-dmz\r\n\r\nThis would result in the following console error during the first reload only:\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecified group object (group1-dmz) does not exist\r\n*** Output from config line xxxx, \" group-object group1-dmz...\"\r\n\r\n   Behavior of Susceptible Configuration in Releases Affected by CSCwe64043 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe64043\"]\r\nCisco ASA Software releases 9.18.3.39, 9.18.3.46, and 9.19.1.12 and Cisco FTD Software Release 7.2.4 are affected by CSCwe64043, and they are affected by the issue described in this advisory only if the object-group-search access-control ACL optimization feature is enabled. For these releases, all object groups that are out of order will load and will not generate a startup-configuration error. However, the impact can be broader. In this example of a susceptible configuration, object-group-search access-control is configured, and Object-group network group1-dmz is in the startup configuration after it is referenced. In this situation, the entire object-group network ���A��� will be impacted. All of its members will be present on the running configuration, but all ACEs will not be installed and will be missing from the show access-list output.\r\n\r\n\r\n!\r\nobject-group-search access-control\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n!\r\n!\r\nObject-group network group2-dmz\r\nObject-group network group3-dmz\r\n!\r\nobject-group network ���A���\r\n group-object group1-dmz\r\n group-object group2-dmz\r\n group-object group3-dmz\r\n!\r\nObject-group network group1-dmz\r\n!\r\n\r\nThis scenario can be observed by comparing the output of the show access-list CLI command before the reload, when all the ACLs are properly applied, and then after the reload, when ACLs were not installed at boot time. This example shows the output before the reload that triggers this issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n# show access-list\r\naccess-list Inside_in line 1 extended deny ip object-group A any (hitcnt=0) 0xd90bfe1b\r\n  access-list Inside_in line 1 extended deny ip v4-object-group A(2147483650) any4(2147549186) (hitcnt=0) 0x95c59a2e\r\n  access-list Inside_in line 1 extended deny ip v4-object-group A(2147483650) any6(2147549187) (hitcnt=0) 0xa35991aa\r\naccess-list Inside_in line 2 extended permit ip object-group B any (hitcnt=0) 0x8beb7d31\r\n  access-list Inside_in line 2 extended permit ip v4-object-group B(2147483652) any4(2147549186) (hitcnt=0) 0x477509a7\r\naccess-list Inside_in line 2 extended permit ip v4-object-group B(2147483652) any6(2147549187) (hitcnt=0) 0x80ea08ea\r\n\r\nThis example shows the output after the reload. ACLs have not been installed properly, and the device is in the problematic state.\r\n\r\n\r\n# show access-list\r\naccess-list Inside_in line 1 extended deny ip object-group A any (hitcnt=0) 0xd90bfe1b\r\naccess-list Inside_in line 2 extended permit ip object-group B any (hitcnt=0) 0x8beb7d31\r\naccess-list Inside_in line 2 extended permit ip v4-object-group B(2147483652) any4(2147549186) (hitcnt=0) 0x477509a7\r\naccess-list Inside_in line 2 extended permit ip v4-object-group B(2147483652) any6(2147549187) (hitcnt=0) 0x80ea08ea",

				"text": "There are no workarounds that address this issue.\r\n\r\nThe information in this section pertains to the recovery of the ACL configuration that is either missing from the running configuration or was not installed at boot time. When implementing one of the recovery options, note the following:\r\n\r\nUpgrading to a fixed release does not recover missing ACLs, so manual recovery is necessary.\r\nAfter implementing one of the recovery options, refrain from adding new object groups into existing access-control rules because doing so could put the configurations out of order and reintroduce this issue. Instead, associate any new object groups with new rules.\r\nAfter the ACLs are manually recovered, Cisco strongly recommends upgrading the device to a fixed software release, as outlined in the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory. For Cisco FTD devices managed by Cisco FMC or Cisco Cloud-Delivered FMC (cdFMC), the configuration recovery and software upgrade can be done at the same time.\r\n  Recovery Options for Cisco FTD Software Releases 7.2.0 through 7.3.1 (Not Affected by CSCwe64043 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe64043\"])\r\nFor these releases, the ACLs are missing from the startup and running configurations. Take one of the following actions, depending on the management device that is used:\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by Cisco FMC or Cisco cdFMC, perform a Force Deploy of the Access Control Policy (ACP) after every reload of the Cisco FTD device to restore the impacted ACLs.\r\nFor devices that are managed by Cisco FMC, Cisco cdFMC, or Cisco Defense Orchestrator, perform a Force Deploy of the Access Control Policy (ACP) from the Cisco FMC or Cisco cdFMC UI.\r\n\r\nCisco FTD devices that are managed by Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) or by Cisco FDM with Cisco Defense Orchestrator are not impacted by this issue.\r\n  Recovery Options for Cisco FTD Software Release 7.2.4 (Affected by CSCwe64043 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe64043\"])\r\nFor this release, the ACLs are present in the startup and running configurations but may not have been properly installed during boot time.\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by Cisco FMC or Cisco cdFMC, the recommended recovery method is to duplicate the current ACP that is associated with the impacted FTD device, associate the duplicate ACP with the Cisco FTD device, and deploy. Do not return or re-associate the FTD device to the former, problematic ACP, and continue to use the duplicate ACP.\r\nAnother recovery option���which is not recommended by Cisco���for devices that are managed by Cisco FMC or Cisco cdFMC is to copy-paste a new ACP into the problematic ACP and deploy it to the Cisco FTD device. To determine any problematic rules, use the show access-list CLI command on the Cisco FTD device and search for any sequence of three or more lines that display remarks only. Three or more lines of remarks are not expected and are an indication of the problematic state. Note the sequential remark keyword in the following example:\r\n\r\n# show running-config access-list\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\naccess-list CSM_FW_ACL_ remark rule-id 268437505: ACCESS POLICY: TEST - Mandatory\r\naccess-list CSM_FW_ACL_ remark rule-id 268437505: L4 RULE: TEST1\r\naccess-list CSM_FW_ACL_ remark rule-id 268437506: ACCESS POLICY: TEST - Mandatory\r\naccess-list CSM_FW_ACL_ remark rule-id 268437506: L7 RULE: TEST2\r\naccess-list CSM_FW_ACL_ remark rule-id 268437504: ACCESS POLICY: TEST - Default\r\naccess-list CSM_FW_ACL_ remark rule-id 268437504: L4 RULE: DEFAULT ACTION RULE\r\naccess-list CSM_FW_ACL_ advanced permit ip any any rule-id 268437504 event-log flow-endsrc_rule_268437506 any rule-id 268437\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by Cisco FMC, Cisco cdFMC, or Cisco Defense Orchestrator, execute the same recovery steps as described for Cisco FTD devices that are managed by Cisco FMC only.\r\n\r\nCisco FTD devices that are managed by Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) or by Cisco FDM with Cisco Defense Orchestrator are not impacted by this issue.\r\n  Recovery Options for Cisco ASA Software Releases 9.18.1 up to 9.18.3.39 and Releases 9.19.1 up to 9.19.1.12 (Not Affected by CSCwe64043 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe64043\"])\r\nFor these releases, the ACLs are missing from the startup and running configurations.\r\n\r\nFor Cisco ASAs that are managed through the CLI or through Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM), add the missing object-group membership under the respective parent object group. To find the missing lines in the ACL configuration that need to be added, use a previous configuration backup and compare it to the current configuration. In general, the following steps can be used to compare two ASA configurations:\r\n\r\nFrom the CLI of the device, copy the running-config and save it to a text file called config1.txt (or any desired name) on your local machine.\r\nGet the second configuration for the comparison from a backup configuration or previously saved configuration.\r\nFrom the CLI, copy the second configuration and save it to a separate text file named config2.txt (or any desired name) on your local machine.\r\nOpen a text editor or a terminal-based diff tool, such as diff or vimdiff, and compare the two configuration files.\r\nAnalyze the differences highlighted by the diff tool, where added lines are typically marked with + and deleted lines with -. The tool will show where changes have occurred, allowing the administrator to compare and understand the changes between the two configurations.\r\n\r\nWhen the ASA is managed by Cisco Security Manager, the administrator can push any deployment to the device and Cisco Security Manager will return the missing configuration lines when Out-of-Band changes is enabled (which is the default).\r\n  Recovery Options for Cisco ASA Software Releases 9.18.3.39, 9.18.3.46, or 9.19.1.12 (Affected by CSCwe64043 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwe64043\"])\r\nFor these releases, the ACLs are present in the startup and running configurations but may not have been properly installed during boot time.\r\n\r\nDevices Managed Using the CLI or Cisco ASDM\r\n\r\nFor Cisco ASAs that are managed through the CLI or Cisco ASDM, in general terms, the administrator will need to remove the problematic object-group member from the parent object group and repeat the show access-list CLI command in order to recover the access list rule(s). In the following example, the root cause of the issue is that object-group network Subnets-3 is sequentially in the running configuration after it is used in object-group network RISK-NETS. This is only an example; the actual information and object-group names are unique to each ASA configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n# show access-list\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\naccess-list Inside_in line 1 extended deny ip object-group RISK-NETS any (hitcnt=0) 0xd90bfe1b\r\naccess-list Inside_in line 2 extended permit ip object-group ALLOW-NETS any (hitcnt=0) 0x8beb7d31\r\n  access-list Inside_in line 2 extended permit ip v4-object-group ALLOW-NETS(2147483652) any4(2147549186) (hitcnt=0) 0x477509a7\r\naccess-list Inside_in line 2 extended permit ip v4-object-group ALLOW-NETS(2147483652) any6(2147549187) (hitcnt=0) 0x80ea08ea\r\n\r\n# show running-config | include object|subnet|access\r\nobject-group network Subnets-1\r\n network-object object Subnet1A\r\n network-object object Subnet1B\r\n!\r\nobject-group network RISK-NETS\r\n group-object Subnets-1\r\n group-object Subnets-3\r\n!\r\nobject-group network Subnets-3\r\n network-object object Subnet3A\r\n network-object object Subnet3B\r\n!\r\n\r\nIn the preceding example, all of the access lists associated with RISK-NETS are not installed because object-group network Subnets-3 is a member, but object-group network Subnets-3 is initialized after RISK-NETS in the running config, due to the sequential order. To remove the problematic object-group and recover the ACL rule, do the following for all rules in the problematic state:\r\n\r\n\r\n# config t\r\n(config)# object-group network RISK-NETS\r\n(config-network-object-group)# no group-object Subnets-3\r\n(config)# access-list Inside_in line 1 extended deny ip object-group RISK-NETS any\r\n\r\nDevices Managed Using Cisco Security Manager\r\n\r\nFor Cisco ASAs that are managed by Cisco Security Manager, the recovery options are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe administrator should duplicate the current ACPs that are associated with the impacted device, associate them with the ASA, and deploy.\r\nThe administrator could paste a new ACP into the same ACPs that was affected by this issue and then deploy to the ASA.\r\n\r\nCustomers who need help with ACL recovery are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. It is important to note that upgrading to a fixed release will not restore the missing ACLs and that manual recovery is required with a subsequent upgrade to a fixed release.",
