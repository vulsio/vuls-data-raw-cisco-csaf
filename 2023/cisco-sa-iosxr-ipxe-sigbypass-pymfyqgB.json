An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the boot parameters for image verification during the iPXE boot process on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot an unverified software image on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 2023 release of the Cisco IOS XR Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.
