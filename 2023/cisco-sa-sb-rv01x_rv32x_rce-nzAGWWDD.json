An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and access unauthorized data. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, administrators may disable the affected feature as described in the Workarounds [\"#workarounds\"] section.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this vulnerability on Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers, disable remote management. To mitigate this vulnerability on Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082 Routers, disable remote management and block access to ports 443 and 60443. The routers will still be accessible through the LAN interface after the mitigation has been implemented.\r\n  Disable Remote Management\r\nTo disable remote management, do the following:\r\n\r\nLog in to the web-based management interface for the device.\r\nChoose Firewall > General.\r\nUncheck the Remote Management check box.\r\n  Block Access to Ports 443 and 60443\r\nFirst, add a new service to the access rules of the device for port 60443. It is not necessary to create a service for port 443 because it is predefined in the services list.\r\n\r\nLog in to the web-based management interface for the device.\r\nChoose Firewall > Access Rules.\r\nClick Service Management.\r\nIn the Service Name field, enter TCP-60443.\r\nFrom the Protocol drop-down list, choose TCP.\r\nIn both of the Port Range fields, enter 60443.\r\nClick Add to List.\r\nClick OK.\r\n\r\nNext, create access rules to block ports 443 and 60443. To create an access rule to block port 443, do the following:\r\n\r\nLog in to the web-based management interface for the device.\r\nChoose Firewall > Access Rules.\r\nClick Add.\r\nFrom the Action drop-down list, choose Deny.\r\nFrom the Service drop-down list, choose HTTPS (TCP 443-443).\r\nFrom the Log drop-down list, choose Log packets match this rule.\r\nFrom the Source Interface drop-down list, choose the option that matches the WAN connection on the device.\r\nFrom the Source IP drop-down list, choose Any.\r\nFrom the Destination IP drop-down list, choose Single.\r\nIn both of the Destination IP fields, enter the WAN IP address.\r\nClick Save.\r\n\r\nTo create an access rule to block port 60443, repeat the preceding steps, but for Step 5, choose HTTPS (TCP 60443-60443) from the Service drop-down list.\r\n\r\nNote: If a second WAN port is being used, two additional ACL rules need to be set up using the WAN number and IP address for the second WAN port.\r\n\r\nWhile this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.",
