				"text": "For certain products that are running Cisco NX-OS Software and are configured for SSH authentication with an X.509 version 3 (X.509v3) certificate, two remote authorization methods are unsupported and could allow for privilege escalation: TACACS+ and certain configurations of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).\r\n\r\nTACACS+ does not properly validate the distinguished name (DN) of the X.509v3 certificate due to a logic error with authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA).\r\nLDAP does not properly validate the DN of the X.509v3 certificate if the enable cert-dn-match configuration command is not present. The enable cert-dn-match configuration command is required for username validation of the DN of the X.509v3 certificate.\r\n\r\nBoth unsupported configurations could allow a user who is authenticating to the device to elevate their privilege level to Administrator because the DN programmed username on the X.509v3 certificate was not validated and therefore did not have to match the username being authenticated.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address the TACACS+ and LDAP authorization issues, along with updates to the documentation for Cisco NX-OS Software. See Details [\"#details\"] for information about configuration changes that can address these security issues.\r\n\r\n",

The configuration is unsupported and the device is affected if the following CLI commands are present:\r\n\r\naaa authorization ssh-certificate default group groupname where the AAA group is configured for TACACS+\r\naaa group server tacacs+ groupname\r\n\r\nThe CLI of a device that is running a fixed release of Cisco NX-OS Software would not accept the unsupported configuration. The following example shows the error message that would be returned on a device that is running a fixed release:\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos# config\r\nEnter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.\r\nnxos(config)# aaa authorization ssh-certificate default group tacacs1\r\naaa function not supported by configured method\r\ncould not update aaa configuration\r\n\r\nWhen a device is upgraded to a fixed release of Cisco NX-OS Software, any existing aaa authorization ssh-certificate default group groupname commands where the AAA group is configured for TACACS+ are removed from the configuration.\r\n  Determine Whether LDAP Authorization with SSH X.509v3 Certificates is Using an Unsupported Configuration\r\nTo determine whether a Cisco NX-OS device is configured to use LDAP for remote authorization, use the show running-config CLI command. The configuration is unsupported and the device is affected if the following conditions are true:\r\n\r\nThe CLI command aaa authorization ssh-certificate default group groupname where the AAA group is configured for LDAP is present.\r\nThe CLI command aaa group server ldap groupname is configured.\r\nThe LDAP configuration does not contain enable cert-dn-match.\r\n\r\nA device is running a supported configuration and is not affected if the CLI command show running-config ldap | include cert-dn-match returns output, as in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos# show running-config ldap | include cert-dn-match\r\nenable cert-dn-match\r\n\r\nFor MDS 9000 Series and Nexus 7000 Series switches that are running a fixed release of Cisco NX-OS Software, the enable cert-dn-match configuration is enabled by default. Cisco recommends keeping this configuration enabled. For Nexus 3000 Series and 9000 Series switches that are running a fixed release, the enable cert-dn-match logic is always implemented, regardless of whether enable cert-dn-match is present in the configuration.",
