In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nNote: These vulnerabilities can be exploited only by valid and authorized users of the Cisco ISE system. As a best practice, customers can restrict console access and admin web access. To configure the access restrictions, choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Settings > Access > IP Access.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20173: Cisco Identity Services Engine XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system of an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have valid Administrator level privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of confidential information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd93719 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd93719\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20173\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.9\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20174: Cisco Identity Services Engine XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack through an affected device.
