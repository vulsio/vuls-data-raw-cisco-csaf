In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20105: Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the change password functionality of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with Administrator-level read-only credentials to elevate their privileges to Administrator with read-write credentials on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of password change requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a read-only administrator and sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to alter the passwords of any user on the system, including an administrative read-write user, and then impersonate that user.\r\n\r\nNote: \"Cisco Expressway Series\" refers to Cisco Expressway Control (Expressway-C) devices and Cisco Expressway Edge (Expressway-E) devices.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvz54058 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz54058\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20105\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.6\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2023-20192: Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the privilege management functionality of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS could allow an authenticated, local attacker with Administrator-level read-only CLI credentials to elevate their privileges to Administrator with read-write credentials on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to incorrect implementation of user role permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application as a read-only CLI administrator and issuing commands normally reserved for administrators with read-write capabilities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands beyond the sphere of their intended access level, including modifying system configuration parameters.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwf28030 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwf28030\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2023-20192\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases. The center and right columns indicate whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in this section.\r\n        Cisco Expressway Series and\r\nCisco TelePresence VCS Release  First Fixed Release for\r\nCVE-2023-20105  First Fixed Release for\r\nCVE-2023-20192          Earlier than 14.0  Migrate to a fixed release.
