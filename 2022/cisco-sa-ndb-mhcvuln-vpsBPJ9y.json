				"text": "Cisco Nexus Dashboard is deployed as a cluster, connecting each service node to two networks:\r\n\r\nData network (fabric0, fabric1)\r\nManagement network (mgmt0, mgmt1)\r\n\r\nFor more information about these interfaces, see the Cisco Nexus Dashboard Deployment Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/dcn/nd/2x/deployment/cisco-nexus-dashboard-deployment-guide-221/nd-deploy-overview-22x.html#concept_fdf_fxg_4mb\"].\r\n\r\nThe scope of these exploits can be limited to the network interfaces that have exposure. The following vulnerability descriptions indicate whether the data network, the management network, or both networks have exposure to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20857: Cisco Nexus Dashboard Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a specific API that is running in the data network and execute arbitrary commands on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for a specific API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the root user in any pod on a node.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwa93560 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa93560\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20857\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20861: Cisco Nexus Dashboard Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web UI that is running in the management network of Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated administrator of the web-based management interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform actions with Administrator privileges on an affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwa75451 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa75451\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20861\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.8\r\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20858: Cisco Nexus Dashboard Container Image Read and Write Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access a service that is running in the data and management networks on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient access controls for a service that manages container images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening a TCP connection to the affected service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download container images or upload malicious container images to an affected device. The malicious images would be run after the device has rebooted or a pod has restarted.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwb24518 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb24518\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20858\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.2\r\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n   Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in this section.\r\n    Cisco Nexus Dashboard Release First Fixed Release     1.11 Migrate to a fixed release.   2.0 Migrate to a fixed release.   2.1 Migrate to a fixed release.   2.2 2.2(1e)\r\n1. This release is not affected by the vulnerability CVE-2022-20858 (CSCwb24518).\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
