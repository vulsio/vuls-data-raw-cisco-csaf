				"text": "A vulnerability in the RADIUS feature of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected system to stop processing RADIUS packets.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain RADIUS requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to a network or a service where the access server is using Cisco ISE as the RADIUS server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause Cisco ISE to stop processing RADIUS requests, causing authentication/authorization timeouts, which would then result in legitimate requests being denied access.\r\n\r\nNote: To recover the ability to process RADIUS packets, a manual restart of the affected Policy Service Node (PSN) is required. See the Details [\"#details\"] section for more information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

That node will need to be restarted.\r\nIn a multi-node deployment, only the affected PSN node will need to be restarted.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Cisco ISE personas, see the Cisco ISE Admin Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_1/b_ISE_admin_31_deployment.html#typesofpersonas\"].\r\n\r\nNote: If PSNs are behind a load balancer, the exploit traffic can cascade across to other PSNs.\r\n\r\nNote: If PSN node groups are configured, the exploit traffic will not cascade across to other PSNs.\r\n  Restart Cisco ISE\r\nThe procedure that follows is for stopping and then starting a Cisco ISE node from the CLI. During the restart period, any devices already authenticated will still be connected to the network. New authentications will not be processed unless PSN failover is configured.\r\n\r\nMore details on each command can be found in the  Cisco Identity Services Engine CLI Reference Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/cli_guide/b_ise_cli_reference_guide_31/b_ise_CLIReferenceGuide_31_chapter_01.html#wp1286764740\"].\r\n\r\nLog onto the affected PSN via the CLI.\r\nIssue the command application stop ise.\r\nWait for the prompt to return.\r\nIssue the command application start ise.\r\nWait for the prompt to return.\r\nIssue the command show application status ise to see the status of the processes. When the Application Server is running, authentications will take place and the node will be accessible via the GUI.\r\n  PSN Failover Information\r\nFor PSN failover options, see the Policy Service Nodes and Node Groups section of this CiscoPress article [\"https://www.ciscopress.com/articles/article.asp?p=2812072&seqNum=2\"].\r\nFor information on how to configure node groups, see the Policy Service Node section of the Cisco ISE Admin Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_1/b_ISE_admin_31_deployment.html?bookSearch=true#ID64\"].",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in this section.\r\n        Cisco ISE Software Release  First Fixed Release          2.1 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      2.2P16 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      2.2P17 and later  Migrate to fixed release.      2.3  Not vulnerable.      2.4P11 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      2.4P12 and later  Migrate to fixed release.      2.6P4 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      2.6P5 and later  2.6P111 (Target May 19, 2022)      2.7P1 and earlier  Not vulnerable.      2.7P2 and later  2.7P6      3.0  3.0P5      3.1  3.1P1\r\n1.
