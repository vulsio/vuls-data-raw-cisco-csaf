				"text": "A vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) and RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the storage of certain unencrypted credentials. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the audit logs on an affected system and obtaining credentials that they may not normally have access to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use those credentials to access confidential information, some of which may contain personally identifiable information (PII).\r\n\r\nNote: To access the logs that are stored in the RoomOS Cloud, an attacker would need valid Administrator-level credentials.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

If it is enabled, a full capture of network traffic will be included in the logs. PII will also be included.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n  Determine Whether Extended Logging Mode is Enabled\r\nTo determine whether extended logging mode is enabled, complete the following steps:\r\n\r\nChoose the Cisco device name or address.\r\nFor all products except Board Pro, Desk Mini, and Desk Hub, it is at the top of the interface.\r\nFor Board Pro and Desk Mini, swipe in from the right to open the Control Panel.\r\nFor Desk Hub, tap the controls icon in the upper right corner to open the Control Panel.\r\n\r\nChoose Device settings (Board Pro, Desk Mini, or Desk Hub) or Settings (other products).\r\nOpen Issues and diagnostics and check the extended logging toggle button.",

Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.",
