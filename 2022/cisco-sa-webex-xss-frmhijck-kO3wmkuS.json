An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwb73634\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20820\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20852: Cisco Webex Meetings Frame Hijacking Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a Frame Hijacking attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because certain pages of the web interface do not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to embed arbitrary frames in the context of a legitimate Cisco Webex Meetings web page and conduct further social engineering-based attacks.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwb85915\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20852\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N",
