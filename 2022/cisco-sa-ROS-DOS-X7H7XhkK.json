In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\n Cisco Collaboration Endpoint Software Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web engine feature of Cisco Telepresence CE Software and RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient neutralization of URIs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using debug URIs in the web engine. A successful exploit could allow the attacker simulate a process crash resulting in a DoS of the device.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw12003 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw12003\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20764\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H\r\n\r\nCisco Collaboration Endpoint Software Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web engine feature of Cisco Telepresence CE Software and RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive data on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient neutralization of URIs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using debug URIs in the web engine. A successful exploit could allow the attacker view sensitive information regarding the affected device.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw11997 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw11997\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20792\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N\r\n\r\nCisco Collaboration Endpoint Software Redirection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web engine feature of Cisco Telepresence CE Software and RoomOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect users to an attacker controlled destination.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted redirection URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to redirect users to an attacker controlled destination.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvw12005 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw12005\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20794\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in this section.\r\n        Cisco TelePresence CE Software Release  First Fixed Release          Earlier than 9  Migrate to a fixed release.      9  9.15.0.11      10  10.8.2.5\r\nCisco  has addressed this vulnerability in Cisco  RoomOS, which is cloud based. No user action is required. Customers can determine the current remediation status or software version by using the Help function in the service GUI. Customers who need additional information are advised to contact the Cisco  Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n        Cisco  RoomOS Software  First Fixed Release          Earlier than RoomOS May 2021  RoomOS May 2021\r\nThe Cisco  Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
