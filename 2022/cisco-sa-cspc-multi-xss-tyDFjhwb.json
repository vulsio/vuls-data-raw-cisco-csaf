An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates to address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n",
