				"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Secure Network Analytics, formerly Stealthwatch Enterprise, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttention: Simplifying the Cisco portfolio includes the renaming of security products under one brand: Cisco Secure.
