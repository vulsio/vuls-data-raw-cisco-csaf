An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute remote code on the affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid Administrator credentials on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
