				"text": "A vulnerability in the password-recovery disable feature of Cisco IOS XE ROM Monitor (ROMMON) Software for Cisco Catalyst Switches could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to recover the configuration or reset the enable password.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a problem with the file and boot variable permissions in ROMMON. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rebooting the switch into ROMMON and entering specific commands through the console. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read any file or reset the enable password.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n\r\nDetermine the Cisco IOS XE ROMMON Software Release\r\n\r\nTo determine which Cisco IOS XE ROMMON Software release is running on a device, log in to the device and use the show version | include BOOTLDR CLI command. The following example shows the output of this command for a device that is running Cisco IOS XE ROMMON Software Release 17.5.1r:\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitch# show version | include BOOTLDR\r\nBOOTLDR: System Bootstrap, Version 17.5.1r [FC4], RELEASE SOFTWARE (P)\r\n\r\nDetermine Whether the Password-Recovery Disable Feature is Enabled\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the password-recovery disable feature is enabled, log in to the device and use the show romvar | include SWITCH_DISABLE_PASSWORD_RECOVERY CLI command. The following example shows the output of a device that has the password-recovery disable feature enabled (SWITCH_DISABLE_PASSWORD_RECOVERY value is \"1\"):\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitch# show romvar | include SWITCH_DISABLE_PASSWORD_RECOVERY\r\nSWITCH_DISABLE_PASSWORD_RECOVERY=\"1\"\r\n\r\nIf the value is \"0\" or the SWITCH_DISABLE_PASSWORD_RECOVERY is not shown in the show romvar CLI command, the password-recovery disable feature is not enabled.",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nAt the time of publication, the release information in the following table(s) was accurate.

ROMMON software is bundled with the Cisco IOS XE binary, which can be downloaded from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com. It is not available as a standalone binary.\r\n\r\nCustomers who want to upgrade ROMMON to a fixed release will need to upgrade the Cisco IOS XE Software to a fixed release. On first boot, Cisco IOS XE Software will check the installed ROMMON release and upgrade it to the included release if the device is running an older release. A second reboot will be required to activate the upgraded ROMMON.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
