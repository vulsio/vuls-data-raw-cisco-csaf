				"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Server Message Block Version 2 (SMB2) processor of the Snort detection engine on multiple Cisco products could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured policies or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to improper management of system resources when the Snort detection engine is processing SMB2 traffic. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a high rate of certain types of SMB2 packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of the Snort process, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nNote: When the snort preserve-connection option is enabled for the Snort detection engine, a successful exploit could also allow the attacker to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network. The snort preserve-connection setting is enabled by default. See the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory for more information.\r\n\r\nNote: Only products that have Snort 3 configured are affected. Products that are configured with Snort 2 are not affected.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snort-smb-3nfhJtr [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-wsa-unauth-devreset\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the November 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.

The behavior for traffic flows that begin while the Snort process is down is not configuration dependent and always results in a DoS condition. For details on the snort preserve-connection setting, see the Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Command Reference [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/command_ref/b_Command_Reference_for_Firepower_Threat_Defense/c_3.html#wp1594004510\"] and the Snort Restart Traffic Behavior [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/configuration/guide/fpmc-config-guide-v70/policy_management.html#concept_uc1_gtq_ty\"] section of the Firepower Management Center Configuration Guide.\r\n  snort preserve-connection Is Enabled\r\nWhen the snort preserve-connection option is enabled for the Snort detection engine, existing traffic flow are not dropped when the Snort process goes down. Instead, existing traffic flows bypass the Snort detection engine. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to bypass the configured policies and deliver a malicious payload to the protected network. Traffic flows that begin while the Snort process is down are dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThe CVSS score for existing traffic flows is as follows: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nThe CVSS score for new traffic flows is as follows: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L\r\n  snort preserve-connection Is Disabled\r\nWhen the snort preserve-connection option is disabled for the Snort detection engine, existing traffic flows are dropped. A successful exploit could result in a DoS condition. Traffic flows that begin while the Snort process is down are also dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThe CVSS score is the same for both new and existing traffic flows: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L\r\n  Determine the Cisco FTD Software Configuration\r\nThe snort preserve-connection setting is enabled by default.
