In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20842: Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Remote Code Execution and Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV340, RV340W, RV345, and RV345P Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc00210 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc00210\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20842\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20827: Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Web Filter Database Update Command Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web filter database update feature of Cisco Small Business RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a command injection and execute commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the web filter database update feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwb58268 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb58268\"], CSCwb58273 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb58273\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20827\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.0\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20841: Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Open Plug and Play Command Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Open Plug and Play (PnP) module of Cisco Small Business RV160, RV260, RV340, and RV345 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must leverage a man-in-the-middle position or have an established foothold on a specific network device that is connected to the affected router.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwb98961 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb98961\"], CSCwb98964 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb98964\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20841\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n   Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in the following table(s):\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20827 and CVE-2022-20841\r\n    Cisco Product Affected Releases First Fixed Release     RV160 and RV260 Series Routers Earlier than 1.0.01.05 Not vulnerable   RV160 and RV260 Series Routers 1.0.01.05 1.0.01.09   RV340 and RV345 Series Routers Earlier than 1.0.03.26 Not vulnerable   RV340 and RV345 Series Routers 1.0.03.26 1.0.03.28\r\nCVE-2022-20842\r\n    Cisco Product Affected Releases First Fixed Release     RV340 and RV345 Series Routers 1.0.03.26 and earlier 1.0.03.28\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
