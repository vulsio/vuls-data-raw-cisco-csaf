In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20731: Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches Boot Loader Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the boot loader of Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker with level 15 privileges or an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to an affected device to execute persistent code at boot time and break the chain of trust.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because Secure Boot is not properly enabled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute persistent code on the underlying operating system.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvz34674 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz34674\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20731\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20661: Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst Micro Switches Permanent Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the boot loader of Cisco Catalyst Digital Building Series Switches and Cisco Catalyst Micro Switches could allow an unauthenticated attacker with physical access to an affected device to permanently prevent the device from booting, resulting in a permanent denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected devices have an internal Cisco development boot loader that includes capabilities beyond those present in a normal boot loader. An attacker with physical access to an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by causing the device to reboot, breaking into the ROM monitor (ROMMON) during the boot cycle, and then executing specific commands at the ROMMON prompt. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to irrecoverably corrupt the boot ROM in such a way that the device will be unable to boot correctly during the next boot cycle. The device will continue to operate normally until it is reloaded or power-cycled.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases.
