An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device as the bworks user. This would allow the attacker to read arbitrary files in the file system and or interrupt some of the running processes.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwd06681 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwd06681\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20958\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20951: Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software Server-Side Request Forgery Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain confidential information from the Cisco BroadWorks server and other devices on the network.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the left column lists Cisco software releases. The second column indicates whether a patch for these vulnerabilities was released and the release number through which the patch can be found. The right columns list the file names of the available patches. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in this section.\r\n        Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software Release  First Fixed Release  Patch Filename for CVE-2022-20958  Patch Filename for CVE-2022-20951          Earlier than 23.0  Migrate to a fixed release.1  -  -      23.0  CommPilot-23 version 2022.11_1.273  AP.as.23.0.1075.ap383998\r\nAP.xsp.23.0.1075.ap383998  AP.as.23.0.1075.ap384389\r\nAP.xsp.23.0.1075.ap384389      24.0  CommPilot-24 version 2022.11_1.273  AP.as.24.0.944.ap383998  AP.as.24.0.944.ap384389      25.0  CommPilot-25 version 2022.11_1.273  -  -\r\n1. Cisco BroadWorks CommPilot Application Software releases earlier than Release 23.0 have reached end of software maintenance.
