In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20656: Cisco PI and Cisco EPNM Path Traversal Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco PI and Cisco EPNM could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a path traversal attack on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the HTTPS URL by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary files to the host system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvz43433 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz43433\"], CSCvz46488 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz46488\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20656\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20657: Cisco PI and Cisco EPNM Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco PI and Cisco EPNM could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct an XSS attack against a user of the interface of an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvz43419 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz43419\"], CSCvz46476 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz46476\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20657\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N",
