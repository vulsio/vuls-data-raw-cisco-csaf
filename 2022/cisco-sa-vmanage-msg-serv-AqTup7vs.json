				"text": "A vulnerability in the binding configuration of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software containers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker who has access to the VPN0 logical network to also access the messaging service ports on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the messaging server container ports on an affected system lack sufficient protection mechanisms. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the messaging service ports of the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to send network traffic to interfaces within the VPN0 logical network. This network may be restricted to protect logical or physical adjacent networks, depending on device deployment configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view and inject messages into the messaging service, which can cause configuration changes or cause the system to reload.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

They may be configured in the following ways depending on deployment:\r\n\r\nConfigure ACLs on Cisco IOS devices. For information about preventing exploitation of Cisco IOS devices, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists [\"http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml\"].\r\nConfigure ACLs at the firewall that protects Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software. For information about Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) ACL configuration, see Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide: Access Control Lists [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa916/configuration/firewall/asa-916-firewall-config/access-acls.html\"].\r\nCisco Cloud Controllers ACLs (Inbound Rules allowed list) are managed through the Self-Service Portal. Customers will have to review their ACL configurations on the Self-Service Portal to ensure that they are correct. This does not involve updating the controller version. By default, Cisco-hosted devices are protected against the issue described in the advisory unless the customer has explicitly allowed access. For more information, see Cisco SD-WAN Cloud Hosted Controllers Provisioning [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/knowledge-base/CloudOps/b-cisco-sdwan-cloudops/m-provisioning.html#concept_ocl_kgh_nlb\"].\r\n\r\nWhile these workarounds have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in the following table(s):\r\n        Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Release  First Fixed Release           Earlier than 20.3  Migrate to a fixed release.      20.3  Migrate to a fixed release.      20.6  20.6.4      20.7  Migrate to a fixed release.      20.8  Migrate to a fixed release.      20.9  20.9.1\r\nNote: It is the customer���s responsibility to upgrade their cloud controllers to the latest version in which this vulnerability is fixed.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
