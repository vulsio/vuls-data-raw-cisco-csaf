				"text": "A vulnerability in the web management interface of Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, formerly Cisco Security Management Appliance (SMA), and Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information from a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) external authentication server connected to an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization while querying the external authentication server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted query through an external authentication web page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information, including user credentials from the external authentication server. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid operator-level (or higher) credentials.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu\"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the applicable table in this section. In the following table(s), the left column lists major releases of Cisco AsyncOS Software. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco Secure Email and Web Manager: CSCvz40090 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz40090\"]\r\n        AsyncOS Software Release    First Fixed Release          111 and earlier  Migrate to fixed release.      12  Migrate to fixed release.      12.8  Migrate to fixed release.      13.0  Migrate to Fixed Release.      13.6  13.6.2-090      13.8  Migrate to fixed release.      14.0  Migrate to fixed release.      14.1  14.1.0-227\r\n1. Cisco AsyncOS Software releases earlier than Release 11 have reached end of software maintenance. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco Email Security Appliance: CSCvz20942 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz20942\"]\r\n        AsyncOS Software Release    First Fixed Release          Earlier than 111  Migrate to fixed release.      11  Migrate to fixed release.      12  Migrate to fixed release.      13  Migrate to fixed release.      14  14.0.2-020\r\n1. Cisco AsyncOS Software releases earlier than Release 11 have reached end of software maintenance. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.\r\n\r\nCisco Cloud Email Security (CES) includes Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager devices as part of the service solution. Cisco provides regular maintenance of the products included in this solution. Customers can also request a software upgrade by contacting Cisco CES support.",
