An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the April 2022 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: April 2022 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software and have the HTTP feature enabled. All vulnerable releases of Cisco IOS XE Software are within the 3SE and 3E release trains.\r\n\r\nFor more information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determine the HTTP Server Configuration\r\nTo determine whether the HTTP Server feature is enabled for a device, log in to the device and use the show running-config | include ip http server|secure|active command in the CLI to check for the presence of the ip http server command or the ip http secure-server command in the global configuration. If either command is present, the HTTP Server feature is enabled for the device.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the show running-config | include ip http server|secure|active command for a device that has the HTTP Server feature enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter# show running-config | include ip http server|secure|active\r\nip http server\r\nip http secure-server\r\n\r\nNote: The presence of either command or both commands in the device configuration indicates that the web UI feature is enabled.\r\n\r\nIf the ip http server command is present and the configuration also contains ip http active-session-modules none, the vulnerability is not exploitable over HTTP.\r\n\r\nIf the ip http secure-server command is present and the configuration also contains ip http secure-active-session-modules none, the vulnerability is not exploitable over HTTPS.",

				"text": "There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there are mitigations.\r\n\r\nDisabling the HTTP Server feature eliminates the attack vector for this vulnerability and may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. To disable the HTTP Server feature, use the no ip http server  or no ip http secure-server  command in global configuration mode. If both the HTTP server and HTTPS server are in use, both commands are required to disable the HTTP Server feature.\r\n\r\nDisabling HTTP and HTTPS for management functions can also be a suitable mitigation. Use the ip http active-session-modules none and ip http secure-active-session-modules none commands.\r\n\r\nWhile these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#ssu\"] that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release—for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.",
