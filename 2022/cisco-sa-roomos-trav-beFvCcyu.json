An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the xAPI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read and write arbitrary files in the device and escalate privileges from admin to root. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have an Administrator account.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
