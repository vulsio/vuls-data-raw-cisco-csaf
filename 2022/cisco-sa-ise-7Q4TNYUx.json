In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nNote: These vulnerabilities can be exploited only by valid and authorized users of the Cisco ISE system. As a best practice, customers can restrict console access and admin web access. To configure the access restrictions, choose Administration > System > Admin Access > Settings > Access > IP Access.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20964: Cisco Identity Services Engine tcpdump Feature Command Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of user input within requests as part of the web-based management interface tcpdump feature. An attacker with privileges sufficient to access the tcpdump feature could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating requests to the web-based management interface to contain operating system commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the web services user. The chaining of further issues could allow an attacker with command line access to elevate privileges to root and gain complete control over the system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc98823 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc98823\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20964\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 6.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20966: Cisco Identity Services Engine tcpdump Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks against other users of the application web-based management interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of input to an application feature before storage within the web-based management interface tcpdump feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating entries that contain malicious HTML or script code within the application interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious HTML or script code within the application interface for use in further cross-site scripting attacks.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc98831 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc98831\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20966\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20967: Cisco Identity Services Engine External RADIUS Server Feature Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface External RADIUS Server feature of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks against other users of the application web-based management interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of input to an application feature before storage within the External RADIUS Server feature of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating entries within the application interface that contain malicious HTML or script code. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to store malicious HTML or script code within the application interface for use in further cross-site scripting attacks.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc98833 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc98833\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20967\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20965: Cisco Identity Services Engine Access Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass security restrictions within the web-based management interface.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper access control on a feature within the web-based management interface of the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing features through direct requests, thus bypassing checks within the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take privileged actions within the web-based management interface that should be otherwise restricted.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc98828 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc98833\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20965\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in this section.\r\n        Cisco ISE Release  First Fixed Release          2.6 and earlier  Migrate to a fixed release.      2.71  2.7p9       3.0  3.0p7      3.1  3.1p6      3.2  3.2p1\r\n1.
