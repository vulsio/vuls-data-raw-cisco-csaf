An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by submitting specific commands to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to root and execute arbitrary commands on the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading unsigned software on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to install and boot a malicious software image or execute unsigned binaries on the device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using man-in-the-middle techniques to intercept the traffic between the affected device and the server, and then using a forged certificate to impersonate the server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to force the affected device to download arbitrary software images and launch further attacks, combining other vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

The attacker could obtain partial administrative privileges and perform unauthorized actions.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the use of weak entropy for session identifier generation functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability either by using brute force to determine a current session identifier and then reusing the identifier to take over an ongoing session or by crafting a new, valid session identifier and bypassing the whole authentication mechanism. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to take actions within the web UI with privileges up to the level of the administrative user and launch further attacks, exploiting the other vulnerabilities described in this advisory.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in the following table(s):\r\n        Cisco Product  Vulnerable Releases  First Fixed Release          RV160 and RV260 Series Routers  1.0.01.05 and earlier  1.0.01.07      RV340 and RV345 Series Routers  1.0.03.24 and earlier  1.0.03.26\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
