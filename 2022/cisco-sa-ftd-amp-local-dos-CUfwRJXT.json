An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted file through the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the local malware analysis process to crash, which could result in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nManual intervention may be required to recover from this situation.\r\nMalware cloud lookup and dynamic analysis will not be impacted.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the April 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.
