An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary file path information when using commands in the CLI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files from the file system of the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.
