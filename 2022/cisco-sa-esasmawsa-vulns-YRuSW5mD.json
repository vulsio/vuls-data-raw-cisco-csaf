In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20867: Cisco ESA and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager Next Generation Management SQL Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the next-generation UI management interface of Cisco ESA and Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks as root on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have the credentials of a high-privileged user account.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-submitted parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain data or modify data that is stored in the underlying database of the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc12185 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/%20CSCwc12185\"] and CSCwc12186 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc12186\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20867\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20868: Cisco ESA, Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance Next Generation Management Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the next-generation UI management interface of Cisco ESA, Cisco Secure Email and Web Manager, and Cisco Secure Web Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the use of a hard-coded value to encrypt a token that is used for certain API calls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and sending a crafted HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impersonate another valid user and execute commands with the privileges of that user account.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwc12181 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc12181\"], CSCwc12183 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc12183\"] and CSCwc12184 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwc12184\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20868\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by one of the vulnerabilities that is described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for that vulnerability.
