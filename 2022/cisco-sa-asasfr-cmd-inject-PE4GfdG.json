				"text": "A vulnerability in the CLI parser of Cisco FirePOWER Software for Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) FirePOWER module could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of an affected ASA FirePOWER module as the root user.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of undefined command parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted command on the CLI or by submitting a crafted HTTPS request to the web-based management interface of the Cisco ASA that is hosting the ASA FirePOWER module.\r\n\r\nNote: To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have administrative access to the Cisco ASA. A user who has administrative access to a particular Cisco ASA is also expected to have administrative access to the ASA FirePOWER module that is hosted by that Cisco ASA.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected Cisco ASA FirePOWER modules if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco FirePOWER Software and were configured to block all access to the Linux shell using the system lockdown[-sensor] CLI command.\r\n\r\nNote: The attack vector through an HTTPS request is open only if HTTPS management access is enabled on the Cisco ASA that is hosting the ASA FirePOWER module.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n  Determine the ASA FirePOWER Module Lockdown Configuration\r\nTo determine if lockdown mode is enabled on the ASA FirePOWER module, log in to the ASA FirePOWER module with administrative privileges and enter ?. If the expert command does not appear in the list of available commands, lockdown mode is enabled.\r\n  Determine the HTTPS Management Access Configuration\r\nTo identify the status of HTTPS management access, use the show running-config http CLI command. The following example shows the output of the show running-config http command on a device that has HTTPS management access enabled on the inside interface:\r\n\r\n\r\nasa# show running-config http\r\nhttp server enable\r\nhttp 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 inside\r\n\r\n\r\nThe HTTPS management access is disabled if one of the following is true:\r\n\r\nThe line that starts with http server enable is missing.\r\nThe output of the show running-config http command does not include an HTTP access control list (ACL) that is associated with an interface.\r\n\r\nIf the output does include an HTTP ACL, the exact value of the HTTP ACL does not affect the vulnerability status of the device. However, for successful exploitation, the attacker must be able to connect to the HTTPS management server of the device from an IP address that is permitted by the HTTP ACL.\r\n\r\nIf the line that starts with http server enable does not include a port, as in the example above, the default port 443 is used. The exact port value does not affect the vulnerability status of the device.",
