In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerability.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20814: Cisco Expressway-C and Cisco TelePresence VCS Improper Certificate Validation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the certificate validation of Cisco Expressway-C and Cisco TelePresence VCS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a lack of validation of the SSL server certificate that an affected device receives when it establishes a connection to a Cisco Unified Communications Manager device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a man-in-the-middle technique to intercept the traffic between the devices, and then using a self-signed certificate to impersonate the endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the intercepted traffic in clear text or alter the contents of the traffic.\r\n\r\nNote: Cisco Expressway-E is not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwa25108 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa25108\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20814\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20853: Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS Cross-Site Request Forgery Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the REST API to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected system to reload.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwa25097 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa25097\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20853\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for these vulnerabilities. Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in this section.\r\n        Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS Release  First Fixed Release for CSCwa25097  First Fixed Release for CSCwa25108          Earlier than 14.0  Migrate to a fixed release.
