In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCisco Enterprise NFVIS Guest Escape Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the Next Generation Input/Output (NGIO) feature of Cisco Enterprise NFVIS could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to escape from the guest VM to gain unauthorized root-level access on the NFVIS host.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient guest restrictions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an API call from a VM that will execute with root-level privileges on the NFVIS host. A successful exploit could allow the attacker compromise the NFVIS host completely.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s):CSCvz73973 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz73973\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20777\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.9\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCisco Enterprise NFVIS Command Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the image registration process of Cisco Enterprise NFVIS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject commands that execute at the root level on the NFVIS host during the image registration process.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an administrator on the host machine to install a VM image with crafted metadata that will execute commands with root-level privileges during the VM registration process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject commands with root-level privileges into the NFVIS host.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s):CSCvz73988 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz73988\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20779\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCisco Enterprise NFVIS XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the import function of Cisco Enterprise NFVIS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to leak system data from the host to any configured VM.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the resolution of external entities in the XML parser. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an administrator to import a crafted file that will read data from the host and write it to any configured VM. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access system information from the host, such as files containing user data, on any configured VM.\r\n\r\nNote: An attacker who already has authenticated access on a VM that is configured within the NFVIS host could obtain direct access to the confidential system information.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s):CSCvz73971 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz73971\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20780\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.4\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N",

Customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels.\r\n\r\nCustomers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe Cisco Support and Downloads page [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html\"] on Cisco.com provides information about licensing and downloads. This page can also display customer device support coverage for customers who use the My Devices tool.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"] as indicated in the following table(s):\r\n        Cisco Enterprise NFVIS Release  First Fixed Release          Earlier than 4.0  Migrate to a fixed release.      4.0  4.7.1\r\nThe Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) validates only the affected and fixed release information that is documented in this advisory.",
