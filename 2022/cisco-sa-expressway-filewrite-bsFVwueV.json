				"text": "The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20806: Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the cluster database API of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read/write privileges on the application to obtain sensitive information and cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device with read/write privileges and issuing a crafted command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the underlying operating system at a rate that impacts system performance.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvz71486 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvz71486\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20806\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20807: Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the file-parsing logic of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with read/write privileges to obtain sensitive information on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information on an affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwa25061 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa25061\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20807\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.9\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2022-20809: Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence VCS Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the logging component of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information in clear text on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to the storage of unencrypted credentials in certain logs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the logs on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view the credentials of other users of the shared device. This vulnerability only occurs when debug logging is enabled on the device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCwa25106 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa25106\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2022-20809\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N",
