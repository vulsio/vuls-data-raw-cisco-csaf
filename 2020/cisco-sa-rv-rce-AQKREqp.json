				"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-rce-AQKREqp [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-rv-rce-AQKREqp\"]",

By default, the remote management feature is disabled for these devices.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether the remote management feature is enabled for a device, administrators can open the web-based management interface and choose Basic Settings > Remote Management. If the Enable box is checked, remote management is enabled for the device.",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed firmware release as indicated in the following table:\r\n        Cisco Product  First Fixed Release            RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall  1.2.2.8      RV130 VPN Router  1.0.3.54      RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router  1.0.3.54      RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router  1.3.1.7\r\nTo download the software from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com [\"http://cisco.com/\"], do the following:\r\n\r\nRV110W and RV215W\r\n\r\nClick Browse all.\r\nChoose Routers > Small Business Routers > Small Business RV Series Routers > RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall or RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router > Wireless Router Firmware.\r\nChoose a release from the left pane of the RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall or RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router page.\r\n\r\nRV130 and RV130W\r\n\r\nClick Browse all.\r\nChoose Routers > Small Business Routers > Small Business RV Series Routers > RV130 VPN Router or RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router > Small Business Router Firmware.\r\nChoose a release from the left pane of the RV130 VPN Router or RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router page.",
