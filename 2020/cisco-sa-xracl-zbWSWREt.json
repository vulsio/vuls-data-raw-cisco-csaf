An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to access the device through the standby route processor management interface.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

This will mitigate this vulnerability for those applications, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nline template vty\r\n access-class ingress MGMT_ACL_V4\r\n!\r\nvty-pool default 0 9 line-template vty\r\n\r\nFor features that leverage a feature-specific ACL, apply an ACL to the feature itself. This will mitigate this vulnerability for those applications as shown in the following examples:\r\n\r\nNETCONF\r\n\r\n\r\nssh server netconf ipv4 access-list MGMT_ACL_V4\r\n\r\nSSH\r\n\r\n\r\nssh server ipv4 access-list MGMT_ACL_V4\r\n\r\nTelnet\r\n\r\n\r\ntelnet ipv4 server max-servers 3 access-list MGMT_ACL_V4\r\n\r\nFor features that are controlled through management plane protection, apply an out-of-band management plane protection policy, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\ncontrol-plane\r\n management-plane\r\n  out-of-band\r\n   interface MgmtEth0/RSP0/CPU0/0\r\n    allow all peer\r\n     address ipv4 192.168.1.1\r\n    !\r\n   !\r\n   interface MgmtEth0/RSP1/CPU0/0\r\n    allow all peer\r\n     address ipv4 192.168.1.1\r\n    !\r\n   !\r\n\r\nNote: Applications that are accessible on the device that do not require a TTY to be allocated and do not support application-specific ACLs are still exposed.",
