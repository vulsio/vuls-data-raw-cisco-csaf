An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted HTTP request to the API subsystem of an affected system. When this request is processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying operating system (OS).\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate release as indicated in the following tables:\r\n\r\nCisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers\r\n        M3 Servers  Affected Firmware Release  First Fixed Firmware Release          3.0  3.0(1c) to 3.0(4q)  3.0(4r)              M4 Servers  Affected Firmware Release  First Fixed Firmware Release          3.0  3.0(1c) to 3.0(4q)  3.0(4r)      4.0  4.0(1a) to 4.0(2l)  4.0(2n)      4.1  4.1(1c) to 4.1(1f)  4.1(1g)              M5 Servers  Affected Firmware Release  First Fixed Firmware Release          3.1  All releases  Migrate to a fixed release.      4.0  4.0(1a) to 4.0(4l)  4.0(4m)      4.1  4.1(1c) to 4.1(1f)  4.1(1g)\r\nCisco UCS E-Series\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco IMC for E-Series Servers releases 3.2.11.3 and later.\r\n\r\nCisco UCS S-Series\r\n\r\n        Server - S3160  Affected Firmware Release  First Fixed Firmware Release          3.0  3.0(1c) to 3.0(4q)  3.0(4r)              Server - S3260  Affected Firmware Release  First Fixed Firmware Release          3.1  All releases  Migrate to a fixed release.      4.0  4.0(1a) to 4.0(4l)  4.0(4m)      4.1  4.1(1c) to 4.1(1f)  4.1(1g)\r\nCisco 5000 Series ENCS Platforms\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) for Cisco 5000 Series ENCS Platforms releases 4.4.1 and later.",
