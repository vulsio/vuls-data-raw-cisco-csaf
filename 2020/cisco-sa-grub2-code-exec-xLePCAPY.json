				"text": "On July 29, 2020, a research paper titled ���There���s a Hole in the Boot��� was made publicly available. This paper discusses a vulnerability discovered in the GRand Unified Bootloader version 2 (GRUB2) bootloader that may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code at system boot time.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values parsed from the GRUB2 configuration file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted configuration file for GRUB2. When this file is processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary code that is executed before the operating system is loaded on the targeted system.\r\n\r\nOn systems protected by the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) secure boot feature, exploitation of this vulnerability may allow the attacker to tamper with the secure boot process.\r\n\r\nMultiple Cisco products are affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. Any workarounds for a specific Cisco product or service will be documented in the relevant Cisco bugs, which are identified in the Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nThis advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-grub2-code-exec-xLePCAPY [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-grub2-code-exec-xLePCAPY\"]",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that integrate a vulnerable release of the GRUB2 bootloader. The bootloader is software that is executed during the system startup process; it is initialized by the system firmware and performs the necessary initialization for loading the operating system. GRUB2 reads its configuration parameters from a text file. An affected version of GRUB2 improperly performs the bounds checking of specific values parsed from the configuration file.\r\n\r\nAn attacker who can modify this configuration file (by possessing either administrative privileges to the device or physical access to the targeted system) could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted configuration file for GRUB2. When this file is processed, a heap-based buffer overflow may occur. The attacker could use this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution in the preboot environment of an affected system.\r\n\r\nExploitation of this vulnerability would require an attacker to modify the GRUB2 configuration file. Most Cisco devices validate the GRUB2 configuration file during the boot process. An attempt to exploit this vulnerability will cause the digital signature check to fail. When this check fails, the Cisco device will not let that software boot, thereby preventing the malicious code from running.\r\n\r\nOn a subset of Cisco devices, the GRUB2 configuration file is not validated. These products are affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory, and listed in Vulnerable Products [\"#vp\"] section.",
