An attacker with access to the NFVIS CLI of an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by logging into the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the NFVIS CLI with administrator privileges.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCisco fixed this vulnerability in Cisco vWAAS with NFVIS-bundled image release 6.4.3e, 6.4.5a, and later releases.\r\n\r\nNote: ENCS 5400-W Series and CSP 5000-W Series appliances do not support a direct upgrade to vWAAS 6.4.3e and 6.4.5a releases from earlier releases. In order to run a fixed release, customers must do a fresh install with the required version of the Cisco WAAS Unified Package for ENCS 5400-W and CSP 5000-W appliances. Customers are advised to contact their support organization for any assistance required with migrating to a fixed release.\r\n\r\nTo download the software from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com [\"http://cisco.com/\"], do the following:\r\n\r\nClick Browse all.\r\nChoose Routers > Wan Optimization > Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Software > Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Software.\r\nChoose a release from the left pane of the Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) Software page.\r\nDownload the Cisco WAAS Unified Package for ENCS-W and CSP-W Appliances.",
