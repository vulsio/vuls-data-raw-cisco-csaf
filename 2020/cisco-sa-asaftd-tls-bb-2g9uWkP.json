				"text": "A vulnerability in the TLS handler of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for Cisco Firepower 1000 Series firewalls could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper implementation of countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites that rely on RSA for key exchange. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to the device, which would act as an oracle and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-ciphertext attack. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform cryptanalytic operations that may allow decryption of previously captured TLS sessions to the affected device.\r\n\r\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to perform both of the following actions:\r\n\r\nCapture TLS traffic that is in transit between clients and the affected device\r\nActively establish a considerable number of TLS connections to the affected device\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

These features include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\nAnyConnect SSL VPN\r\nClientless SSL VPN\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n  Determine Whether a Device Could Process SSL or TLS Messages\r\nTo determine whether a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software could process SSL or TLS packets, use the show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS command and verify that it returns output. If this command returns any output, the device is vulnerable. If this command returns empty output, the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory. The following example shows the output of the show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS command from a device that is vulnerable:\r\n\r\n\r\nftd# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS\r\nSSL       0005aa68  LISTEN     x.x.x.x:443      0.0.0.0:*\r\nSSL       002d9e38  LISTEN     x.x.x.x:8443     0.0.0.0:*\r\nDTLS      0018f7a8  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443   0.0.0.0:*",

However, disabling use of TLS ciphers that rely on RSA for key exchange is a possible mitigation.\r\n\r\nCisco ASA Software\r\n\r\nTo specify the TLS ciphers to be used on a device that is running Cisco ASA Software, use the ssl cipher   version custom command in global configuration mode. Use a custom string to allow only cipher suites based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DHE). Use the  show ssl ciphers  all command to view the list of supported ciphers for each TLS version.\r\n\r\nCisco FTD Software\r\n\r\nOn devices that are running Cisco FTD Software and are managed through Cisco FMC Software, TLS ciphers can be specified through Cisco FMC Software under Devices > Platform Settings > [Edit | New Policy] > SSL > [Edit | Add]. Then select a Custom security level and add the desired ciphers.\r\n\r\nCisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) does not currently support the selection of specific SSL/TLS ciphers or cipher suites.",
