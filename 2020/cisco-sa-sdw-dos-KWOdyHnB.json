An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP messages to the targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause services on the device to fail, resulting in a DoS condition that could impact the targeted device and other devices that depend on it.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-dos-KWOdyHnB [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-dos-KWOdyHnB\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCisco fixed this vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN Solution Software releases 17.2.7 and later and releases 18.3.0 and later.\r\n\r\nTo ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:\r\n\r\ncisco-sa-sdw-dos-KWOdyHnB [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-dos-KWOdyHnB\"]: Cisco SD-WAN Solution Software Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-sdscred-HfWWfqBj [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdscred-HfWWfqBj\"]: Cisco SD-WAN Solution Software Static Credentials Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-vedgfpdos-PkqQrnwV [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vedgfpdos-PkqQrnwV\"]: Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Routers Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-fpdos-hORBfd9f [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fpdos-hORBfd9f\"]: Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Routers Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-clibypvman-sKcLf2L [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-clibypvman-sKcLf2L\"]: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Command Injection Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-vmdirtrav-eFdAxsJg [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmdirtrav-eFdAxsJg\"]: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Directory Traversal Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-vmanrce-4jtWT28P [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanrce-4jtWT28P\"]: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Remote Code Execution Vulnerability",
