An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to the device, which could allow the attacker to bypass access restrictions. A successful attack could allow the attacker to view sensitive information, including device call logs that contain names, usernames, and phone numbers of users of the device.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-phone-logs-2O7f7ExM [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-phone-logs-2O7f7ExM\"]",
