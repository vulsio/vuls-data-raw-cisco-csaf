A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files that are accessible through the affected software on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ndb-path-traversal-wVDyXZPy [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ndb-path-traversal-wVDyXZPy\"]",
