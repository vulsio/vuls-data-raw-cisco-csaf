				"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious data into a specific data field in the interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have administrative privileges on the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
