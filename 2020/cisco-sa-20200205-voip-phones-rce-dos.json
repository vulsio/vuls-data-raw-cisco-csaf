				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for the Cisco IP Phone could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to remotely execute code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to missing checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute code with root privileges or cause a reload of an affected IP phone, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nNote: Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200205-voip-phones-rce-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200205-voip-phones-rce-dos\"]",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\n  Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed firmware release as indicated in the following table:\r\n                                Cisco IP Phone Model\r\n              Cisco Bug ID\r\n              First Fixed Release                                              IP Conference Phone 7832\r\n              CSCvr96069 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96069\"]              12.7(1)\r\n                                  IP Conference Phone 7832 with Multiplatform Firmware\r\n              CSCvr96060 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96060\"]\r\n              11.3(1)SR1                                   IP Conference Phone 8832              CSCvr96071 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96071\"]              12.7(1)                                  IP Conference Phone 8832 with Multiplatform Firmware                CSCvr96064  [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96064\"]               11.3(1)SR1\r\n                                  IP Phone 6821, 6841, 6851, 6861, 6871 with Multiplatform Firmware              CSCvr96065 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96065\"], CSCvr96067 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96067\"]\r\n              11.3(1)SR1\r\n                                  IP Phone 7811, 7821, 7841, 7861 Desktop Phones               CSCvr96739 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96739\"]              12.7(1)                                  IP Phone 7811, 7821, 7841, 7861 Desktop Phones with Multiplatform Firmware               CSCvr96063 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96063\"]\r\n              11.3(1)SR1                                   IP Phone 8811, 8841, 8851, 8861, 8845, 8865 Desktop Phones              CSCvr96066 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96066\"], CSCvr96069 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96069\"]              12.7(1)                                  IP Phone 8811, 8841, 8851, 8861, 8845, 8865 Desktop Phones with Multiplatform Firmware              CSCvr96058, [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96058\"] CSCvr96059 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96059\"]\r\n              11.3(1)SR1                                   Unified IP Conference Phone 8831               CSCvr96738 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96738\"]                10.3(1)SR6 (Targeted for March 2020)\r\n                                  Unified IP Conference Phone 8831 for Third-Party Call Control               CSCvr96057 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr96057\"]               There is no fixed firmware available at this time.
