				"text": "A vulnerability in the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) additional paths feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to prevent authorized users from monitoring the BGP status and cause the BGP process to stop processing new updates, resulting in a denial of service (DOS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to an incorrect calculation of lexicographical order when displaying additional path information within Cisco IOS XR Software, which causes an infinite loop. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific BGP update from a BGP neighbor peer session of an affected device; an authorized user must then issue a show bgp command for the vulnerability to be exploited. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to prevent authorized users from properly monitoring the BGP status and prevent BGP from processing new updates, resulting in outdated information in the routing and forwarding tables.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "The information in the BGP update that causes this vulnerability is locally generated by the BGP neighbor peer session of the affected device. Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, and Cisco NX-OS Software would never generate a BGP update that would result in the show bgp commands incorrectly calculating the lexicographical order when displaying additional path information. The BGP update would need to come from a BGP implementation other than one done by a Cisco network operating system.\r\n\r\nFor a device to be affected by this vulnerability, both of the following conditions must be met:\r\n\r\nThe BGP update that causes this vulnerability is processed by the device and the data is inserted into the BGP table.\r\nAn authorized user executes show bgp commands that incorrectly calculate lexicographical order when displaying additional path information.\r\n\r\nOnce show bgp commands are executed (as long as the offending data is in the BGP table), the affected device will return an error message that is similar to the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\n% Failed to retrieve data from EDM server: 'sysdb' detected the 'warning' condition 'An\r\nEDM took too long to process a request and was timed out'\r\n\r\nOnce the device is affected, further BGP updates will not be processed. While there is no immediate data plane loss, if there is network churn, information in future BGP updates will fail to update the BGP table and result in outdated routing and forwarding tables.",
