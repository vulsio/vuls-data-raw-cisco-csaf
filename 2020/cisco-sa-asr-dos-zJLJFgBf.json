				"text": "A vulnerability in the IPv6 implementation of Cisco StarOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of the device, leading to a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asr-dos-zJLJFgBf [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asr-dos-zJLJFgBf\"]",

The VPP feature is disabled by default:\r\n\r\nCisco ASR 5000 Series Aggregation Services Routers\r\nCisco Virtualized Packet Core-Single Instance (VPC-SI)\r\n\r\nTo see if the VPP feature is enabled, an administrator can use the show task table process vpp_main all command. If the command lists the vpp_main process, the feature is enabled. The following is a sample output with the VPP feature enabled:\r\n\r\n[local]swch# show task table process vpp_main all\r\n        task                                             parent   cpu facility                 inst    pid pri node  facility      inst    pid  ----   ----------------------------------------------  -------------------------   1/0 vpp_main   1005729   5729   0  all  -                0      0\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases        Cisco StarOS Major Release  First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability          Earlier than 21.15  Migrate to 21.15.31.      21.15  21.15.31      21.16  21.16.4      21.16.c  21.16.c11      21.16.d  Migrate to 21.16.4.      21.17  21.17.4      21.18  Not vulnerable.      21.19  Not vulnerable.",
