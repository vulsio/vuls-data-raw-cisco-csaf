Cisco IOS Software and Guest OS perform inter-VM signaling and control operations by establishing a TCP-based channel.\r\n\r\nGuest OS is available as part of a Cisco IOS Software image bundle that contains the hypervisor, Cisco IOS Software, and Guest OS images. Customers who used a Cisco IOS Software image bundle for performing either an initial installation or a software upgrade will have Guest OS automatically installed as part of the software image bundle installation.",

				"text": "Two vulnerabilities in the Cisco IOx application environment of Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices that are running Cisco IOS Software could allow an attacker to cause a DoS condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities reside in either the ingress packet processing functionality or the implementation of the inter-VM communication channel of Cisco IOS Software for the affected products.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.\r\n  Vulnerability Details\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCisco IOx Application Environment for IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the implementation of the inter-VM communication channel of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system with high privileges.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain type, length, value (TLV) fields of signaling packets that are exchanged between Cisco IOS Software and Guest OS. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device by using low-privileged-user credentials and then sending crafted signaling packets while establishing a TCP session destined to the process that manages the inter-VM communication of an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Cisco IOS Software VM running on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by using malicious TCP packets over either IPv4 or IPv6.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvr15042 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr15042\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2020-3257\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nMitigation for CVE-2020-3257\r\n\r\nCustomers who do not use Guest OS can disable the virtual interface that is managed by Cisco IOS Software. This interface provides connectivity between the Cisco IOS Software VM and Guest OS. Configuring the virtual interface in shutdown mode eliminates the attack vector for this vulnerability and may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. Applying this mitigation will prevent further access to Guest OS.\r\n\r\nThe following table identifies the virtual interface for each affected Cisco product:\r\n        Cisco Product  Virtual Interface          809 Industrial ISRs  Gigabit Ethernet 2      829 Industrial ISRs  Gigabit Ethernet 5      CGR1000  Gigabit Ethernet 0/1\r\nAdministrators can configure the interface in shutdown mode by entering the shutdown command in interface configuration mode. The following example shows the output of the show run interface gigabitEthernet  <id> command for a device that has an interface in shutdown mode:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show run interface gigabitEthernet <id> | i shutdown\r\n  Shutdown\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco IOx Application Environment for IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Guest OS Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the ingress packet processing functionality of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to shut down, reload, or uninstall the Guest OS instance running on an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient isolation of an internal, emulated Ethernet interface that should not process traffic from outside the device when the traffic is destined for the 127.0.0.0/8 range. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious IP packets. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to shut down, reload, or uninstall the Guest OS instance running on an affected device.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvq68872 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvq68872\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2020-3199\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nDetermine Whether Guest OS Is Enabled\r\n\r\nAdministrators can determine whether Guest OS is enabled on a device by using the show iox host list detail | include OS status command in the device CLI.\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the output of the command for a device that has Guest OS enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show iox host list detail | include OS status\r\nOS status: \t\tRUNNING\r\n\r\nIf this command does not exist, or if it produces output that does not show the string RUNNING in the OS status field, the device is not affected by this vulnerability.",

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Cisco IOS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR).
