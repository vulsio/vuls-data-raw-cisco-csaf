An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious ARF or WRF file to a user through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table:\r\n                                Cisco Webex Platform               First Fixed Release                                               Webex Meetings 39.5.x Sites              39.5.17                                  Webex Meetings Latest Sites              40.0                                  Webex Meetings Online1              1.3.43 (CVE-2020-3127)\r\n1.3.49 (CVE-2020-3128)                                  Webex Meetings Server              3.0MR3SecurityPatch1                                  Webex Meetings Server              4.0MR2SecurityPatch2\r\n\r\n1.
