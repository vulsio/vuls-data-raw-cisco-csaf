An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs administrator credentials.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
