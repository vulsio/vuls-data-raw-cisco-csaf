An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the underlying OS.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCVE-ID: CVE-2020-3451\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvu40103 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu40103\"]\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L\r\n\r\nCisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient boundary restrictions on user-supplied input to scripts in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests that contain overly large values to an affected device, causing a buffer overflow. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to temporarily degrade the performance of the interface process or execute arbitrary code on the underlying OS.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCVE-ID: CVE-2020-3453\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvu49391 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu49391\"]\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.3\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV340 Series Routers firmware releases 1.0.03.20 and later.",
