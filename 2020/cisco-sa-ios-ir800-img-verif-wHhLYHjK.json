				"text": "A vulnerability in the image verification feature of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 809 and 829 Industrial Integrated Services Routers (Industrial ISRs) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to boot a malicious software image on  an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient access restrictions on the area of code that manages the image verification feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first authenticating to the targeted device and then logging in to the Virtual Device Server (VDS) of an affected device. The attacker could then, from the VDS shell, disable Cisco IOS Software integrity (image) verification.\r\n\r\nA successful exploit could allow the attacker to boot a malicious Cisco IOS Software image on the targeted device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-ir800-img-verif-wHhLYHjK [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-ir800-img-verif-wHhLYHjK\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the June 3, 2020, release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 23 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 25 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: June 2020 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\" https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-73388\"].",

Cisco IOS Software and Guest OS need to access some shared devices. Examples are embedded multimedia card (eMMC) flash memory, USB ports, and the console. VDS coordinates access to the shared devices and provides communication channels between VMs over emulated Ethernet interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient access restrictions on the area of code that manages the verification of the Cisco IOS Software instance. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to boot a malicious Cisco IOS Software instance on an affected device.",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Cisco IOS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.\r\n        Fixed Releases for All VDS-Related Vulnerabilities in This Bundle of Advisories\r\nThis release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication contains multiple advisories for vulnerabilities that affect VDS. To help ensure a complete upgrade solution for these vulnerabilities, administrators are advised to upgrade affected devices to a fixed software release that addresses all VDS-related advisories in this bundled publication:\r\n\r\ncisco-sa-ios-iot-udp-vds-inj-f2D5Jzrt [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-udp-vds-inj-f2D5Jzrt\"]\r\ncisco-sa-ios-iot-vds-cmd-inj-VfJtqGhE [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-vds-cmd-inj-VfJtqGhE\"]\r\ncisco-sa-ios-iot-vds-cred-uPMp9zbY [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-iot-vds-cred-uPMp9zbY\"]\r\ncisco-sa-ios-ir800-img-verif-wHhLYHjK [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ios-ir800-img-verif-wHhLYHjK\"]",
