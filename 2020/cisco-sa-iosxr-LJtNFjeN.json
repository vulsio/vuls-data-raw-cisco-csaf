An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first authenticating to the local CLI shell on the device and using the CLI command to bypass the task groupâ€“based checks. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges and perform actions on the device without authorization checks.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",
