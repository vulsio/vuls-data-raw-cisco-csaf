				"text": "A vulnerability in the multi-instance feature of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape the container for their Cisco FTD instance and execute commands with root privileges in the host namespace. The attacker must have valid credentials on the device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because a configuration file that is used at container startup has insufficient protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a specific container configuration file on the underlying file system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with root privileges within the host namespace. This could allow the attacker to impact other running Cisco FTD instances or the host Cisco FXOS device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the October 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 17 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 17 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: October 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74302\"].",

If the Deploy Type field has a value of Container, application instances are present and the device is vulnerable. The following example shows the command output for a vulnerable device:\r\n\r\n firepower# scope ssa\r\nfirepower /ssa # show app-instance\r\n        App Name  Identifier  Slot ID  Admin State  Oper State  Running Version  Startup Version  Deploy Type  Turbo Mode  Profile Name  Cluster State  Cluster Role      -----  -------  ------  ------  -----  -------  -------  ------  -----  -----  -------  -------      ftd  ftd1  1  Enabled  Online  6.2.3.14  6.2.3.14  Native  No     Not Applicable  None      ftd  ftd2-1  2  Enabled  Online  6.4.0.4  6.4.0.4  Container  No  mid  Not Applicable  None",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\nCustomers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\nFixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by any of the vulnerabilities described in this bundle and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.\r\nCisco FTD SoftwareCisco FTD Software ReleaseFirst Fixed Release for This VulnerabilityFirst Fixed Release for All Vulnerabilities Described in the Bundle of AdvisoriesEarlier than 6.2.21Multi-instance not supported.Migrate to a fixed release.6.2.2Multi-instance not supported.Migrate to a fixed release.6.2.3Multi-instance not supported.Migrate to a fixed release.6.3.06.3.0.6 (future release)Migrate to a fixed release.6.4.06.4.0.10Migrate to a fixed release.6.5.06.5.0.5 (future release)Migrate to a fixed release.6.6.06.6.16.6.1\r\n1.
