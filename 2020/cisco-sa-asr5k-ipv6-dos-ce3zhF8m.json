				"text": "A vulnerability in the IPv6 implementation of Cisco StarOS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming IPv6 traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 packet to an affected device with the goal of reaching the vulnerable section of the input buffer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is specific to IPv6 traffic. IPv4 traffic is not affected.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asr5k-ipv6-dos-ce3zhF8m [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asr5k-ipv6-dos-ce3zhF8m\"]",

If the command lists the vpp_main process, then the feature is enabled. The following example shows the output of the show task table process vpp_main all command for a device that has the VPP feature enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\n[local]swch# show task table process vpp_main all\r\n        task                                             parent   cpu facility                 inst    pid pri node  facility      inst    pid  ----   ----------------------------------------------  -------------------------   1/0 vpp_main   1005729   5729   0  all  -                0     0",
