				"text": "A vulnerability in the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) implementation in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain OSPF packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted OSPF packets to be processed by an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to continuously consume memory on an affected device and eventually cause it to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-ospf-memleak-DHpsgfnv [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-ospf-memleak-DHpsgfnv\"]\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the May 2020 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 12 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 12 vulnerabilities.

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco products that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software that is configured to support OSPF routing with the capability of processing Link-Local Signaling (LLS) blocks enabled. The LLS block processing is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determine Whether OSPF Routing Is Configured on an ASA Device\r\nTo determine whether OSPF routing is configured on an ASA device, administrators can use the show ospf privileged mode command. If no output is returned, OSPF routing is not configured. In the following example, the device is configured for OSPF routing:\r\n\r\n\r\nasa# show ospf\r\n  Routing Process “ospf 2” with ID 10.1.89.2 and Domain ID 0.0.0.2  Supports only single TOS(TOS0) routes  Supports opaque LSA  .  .  .\r\n    Determine Whether OSPF Routing Is Configured on an FTD Device\r\nTo determine whether OSPF routing is configured on an FTD device, administrators can do one of the following:\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), choose Devices > Device Management, select the device of interest, and then choose Routing > OSPF. If either Process 1 or Process 2 has a check mark, OSPF is enabled on the device.\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), choose Device > Advanced Configuration > View Configuration > Smart CLI > Routing. If there is an object with the type of OSPF, then OSPF is enabled on the device.",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases.
