				"text": "A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS handler of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload unexpectedly, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper error handling on established SSL/TLS connections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing an SSL/TLS connection with the affected device and then sending a malicious SSL/TLS message within that connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software releases 9.13.1.12, 9.13.1.13, and 9.14.1.10 if they have a feature enabled that causes the device to process SSL/TLS messages. These features include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\nAnyConnect SSL VPN1\r\nClientless SSL VPN1\r\nHTTP server used for the management interface\r\n\r\n1. Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliances (ASAv) are not vulnerable for these configurations.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n  Determine Whether a Device Could Process SSL or TLS Messages\r\nTo verify whether a device that is running Cisco ASA Software could process SSL or TLS packets, use the show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS command and verify that it returns output. When this command returns any output, the device is vulnerable. When this command returns empty output, the device is not affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory. The following example shows the output of the show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS command from a device that is vulnerable:\r\n\r\n\r\nftd# show asp table socket | include SSL|DTLS\r\nSSL       0005aa68  LISTEN     x.x.x.x:443      0.0.0.0:*\r\nSSL       002d9e38  LISTEN     x.x.x.x:8443     0.0.0.0:*\r\nDTLS      0018f7a8  LISTEN     10.0.0.250:443   0.0.0.0:*",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCisco has fixed this vulnerability in Cisco ASA Software Release 9.13.1.16 and releases 9.14.1.15 and later.",
