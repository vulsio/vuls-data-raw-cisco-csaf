Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table(s). To ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:\r\n\r\ncisco-sa-vepegr-4xynYLUj [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vepegr-4xynYLUj\"]: Cisco SD-WAN Software Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-vepescm-BjgQm4vJ [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vepescm-BjgQm4vJ\"]: Cisco SD-WAN Software Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-vepeshlg-tJghOQcA [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vepeshlg-tJghOQcA\"]: Cisco SD-WAN Software Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-vepestd-8C3J9Vc [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vepestd-8C3J9Vc\"]: Cisco SD-WAN Software Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-vman-traversal-hQh24tmk [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vman-traversal-hQh24tmk\"]: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Directory Traversal Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-vmanage-escalation-Jhqs5Skf [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanage-escalation-Jhqs5Skf\"]: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\ncisco-sa-vsoln-arbfile-gtsEYxns [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vsoln-arbfile-gtsEYxns\"]: Cisco SD-WAN Software Arbitrary File Creation Vulnerability\r\n\r\n         Cisco SD-WAN Software Release  First Fixed Release for this Vulnerability  First Fixed Release for all Vulnerabilities Described in the Collection of Advisories           Earlier than 18.3  Migrate to a fixed release.
