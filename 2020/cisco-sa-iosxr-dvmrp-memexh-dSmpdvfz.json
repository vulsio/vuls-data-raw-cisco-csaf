				"text": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to either immediately crash the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) process or make it consume available memory and eventually crash. The memory consumption may negatively impact other processes that are running on the device.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities are due to the incorrect handling of IGMP packets. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to immediately crash the IGMP process or cause memory exhaustion, resulting in other processes becoming unstable. These processes may include, but are not limited to, interior and exterior routing protocols.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. There are multiple mitigations available to customers depending on their needs.\r\n\r\n",

				"text": "Although there are no workarounds for these vulnerabilities, there are multiple mitigations available to customers depending on their needs.\r\n\r\nAs a mitigation for the memory exhaustion case, it is recommended that customers implement a rate limiter. This will require that customers understand their current rate of IGMP traffic and set a rate lower than the current average rate. It is worth noting that there is a default limiter in place. In configuration mode, the customer can enter the lpts pifib hardware police flow igmp rate command as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/0/CPU0:router(config)# lpts pifib hardware police flow igmp rate <value>\r\n\r\nThis command will not remove the exploit vector. However, the command will reduce the traffic rate and increase the time necessary for successful exploitation. The customer can use this time to perform recovery actions.\r\n\r\nAs a mitigation for both the memory exhaustion case and the immediate IGMP process crash case, customers may implement an access control entry (ACE) to an existing interface access control list (ACL). Alternatively, the customer can create a new ACL for a specific interface that denies DVMRP traffic inbound on that interface. The following example creates an ACL and denies DVMRP traffic:\r\n\r\n\r\nRP/0/0/CPU0:router(config)# ipv4 access-list <acl_name> deny igmp any any dvmrp",
