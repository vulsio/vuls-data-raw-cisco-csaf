In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCisco fixed this vulnerability in firmware release 2.5.0.92 for the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\n250 Series Smart Switches\r\n350 Series Managed Switches\r\n350X Series Stackable Managed Switches\r\n550X Series Stackable Managed Switches\r\n\r\nCisco fixed this vulnerability in firmware release 1.4.11.4 for the following Cisco products:\r\n\r\n200 Series Smart Switches\r\n300 Series Managed Switches\r\n500 Series Stackable Managed Switches\r\n\r\nTo download the firmware from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html\"] on Cisco.com, do the following:\r\n\r\nClick Browse all.\r\nChoose Switches > LAN Switches ��� Small Business.\r\nChoose a specific product from the right pane of the product selector.\r\nChoose Smart Switch Firmware or Switch Firmware.\r\nChoose a release from the left pane of the page.",
