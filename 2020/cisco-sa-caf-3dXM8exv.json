				"text": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Application Framework component of the Cisco IOx application environment could allow an  authenticated, remote attacker to write or modify arbitrary files in the  virtual instance that is running on the affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of  user-supplied application packages. An attacker who can upload a  malicious package within Cisco IOx could exploit the vulnerability to  modify arbitrary files. The impacts of a successful exploit are limited  to the scope of the virtual instance and do not affect the device that  is hosting Cisco IOx.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-caf-3dXM8exv [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-caf-3dXM8exv\"]",

The following output of the show iox detail command shows a device with the Cisco IOx Application Framework enabled:\r\n\r\n\r\nswitch# show iox detail\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nIOx Processes State:\r\n--------------------\r\ncaf                    : Running\r\nioxhad                 : Running\r\nlibvirtd               : Running\r\nmonit                  : Running\r\n\r\nThe framework is enabled if caf is in the Running state.\r\n\r\nCisco IR510 WPAN Industrial Router\r\n\r\nAdministrators who have access to an IOx (Linux) terminal can use following CLI commands.\r\n\r\nThe following command checks the IOx release:\r\n\r\n\r\n#vi /etc/platform/version\r\n\r\nThe following command checks the Cisco IOx Application Framework status:\r\n\r\n\r\n#monit summary\r\n\r\nAdministrators can also check the IOx status by using get TLV from the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Simple Management Protocol (CSMP) GUI field tool/device manager or from the Field Network Director (FND). The numerical value of the TLV for checking the IOx host status is 146:\r\n\r\n\r\n146\r\n\r\nmessage IoxHostStatus {\r\nrequired uint32 status = 1;\r\noptional string version = 2;\r\noptional uint32 upTime = 3;\r\n}\r\n\r\nIn the preceding TLV, a required uint32 status of 1 indicates that the host is in an up state and operational.\r\n\r\nThe following TLV is used to get the IOx host status:\r\n\r\n\r\n0 ��� unheard, 1 ��� up, 2 ��� down, 3 ��� stopped, 4 ��� disabled\r\nversion: Client firmware version\r\nupTime: Client���s uptime\r\n\r\nCisco CGR1000 Compute Module\r\n\r\nAdministrators can see the status of the IOx functionality by using the show iox host list detail | include IOX Server is running CLI command as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nCGR1000#show iox host list detail | include IOX Server is running\r\nIOX Server is running.
