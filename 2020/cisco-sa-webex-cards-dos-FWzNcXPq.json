The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an adaptive card with malicious content to an existing user of the Cisco Webex Teams client for Windows. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the targeted user's client to crash continuously.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory.
