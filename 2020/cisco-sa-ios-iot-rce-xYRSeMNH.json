Cisco IOS Software and Guest OS need to access some shared devices. Examples are embedded multimedia card (eMMC) flash memory, USB ports, and the console. VDS coordinates access to the shared devices and provides communication channels between VMs over emulated Ethernet interfaces.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software and VDS perform inter-VM signaling and control operations by establishing a UDP channel on UDP port 9700. Signaling packets are not restricted���they are not processed only when they are sent to internal, local communications between VMs. Instead, an affected system will accept and process signaling packets from any interface of an affected device. The impacts of successful exploitation are described in the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory.",

				"text": "Two vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker or an authenticated local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system or cause an affected device to crash and reload.\r\n\r\nThese vulnerabilities reside either in the area of code that manages inter-VM signaling or in one of the diagnostic test CLI commands of Cisco IOS Software for the affected products.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another; exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit the other vulnerability.\r\n  Vulnerability Details\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows.\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the area of code that manages inter-VM signaling of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system or cause an affected system to crash and reload.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 9700 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to remotely execute code in the context of the Cisco IOS Software VM that is running on an affected system or cause an affected device to reload.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by using malicious UDP packets over either IPv4 or IPv6. The malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device; traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvr12083 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr12083\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2020-3198\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nMitigation for CVE-2020-3198\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCustomers can reduce the attack surface by restricting inbound traffic destined for UDP port 9700 of an affected device by implementing an access control list (ACL) or infrastructure access control list (iACL). This may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. Information about access lists is in Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices. [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html\"] Information about iACLs is in Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/43920-iacl.html\"].\r\n\r\nCisco IOS Software for Cisco Industrial Routers Test CLI Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in one of the diagnostic test CLI commands of Cisco IOS Software for Cisco 800 Series Industrial ISRs and Cisco CGR1000 devices could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The attacker must have valid user credentials at privilege level 15.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because, under specific circumstances, the affected software permits modification of the device's run-time memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and issuing a specific diagnostic test command at the CLI. A successful exploit could trigger a logic error in the code that was designed to restrict run-time memory modifications. The attacker could take advantage of this logic error to overwrite system memory locations and execute arbitrary code on an affected device.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvr46885 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvr46885\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2020-3258\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Medium\r\nCVSS Base Score: 5.7\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license.

In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Cisco IOS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco IOS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR).
