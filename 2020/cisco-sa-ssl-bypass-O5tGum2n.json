				"text": "A vulnerability in the Transport Layer Security version 1.3 (TLS 1.3) policy with URL category functionality for Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured TLS 1.3 policy to block traffic for a specific URL.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a logic error with Snort handling of the connection with the TLS 1.3 policy and URL category configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS 1.3 connections to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the TLS 1.3 policy and access URLs that are outside the affected device and normally would be dropped.\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ssl-bypass-O5tGum2n [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ssl-bypass-O5tGum2n\"]",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n      Fixed Release\r\nAt the time of publication, Cisco expected to fix this vulnerability in Cisco FTD Software Release 6.4.0.9, scheduled for May 2020.1 Cisco FTD Software releases earlier than Release 6.4.0 are not vulnerable.\r\n\r\nSee the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n\r\n1. Cisco FMC and FTD Software releases 6.0.1 and earlier have reached end of software maintenance. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco FTD Software, customers can do one of the following:\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), use the FMC interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), use the FDM interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.",
