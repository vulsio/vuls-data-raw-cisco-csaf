				"text": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary actions with administrative privileges on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper handling of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication responses from an external authentication server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain administrative access to the web-based management interface of the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-fmc-auth [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200122-fmc-auth\"]",

				"text": "Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n  Fixed Releases\r\n  In the following table, the left column lists releases of Cisco FMC Software. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a hotfix patch is available for an affected release.\r\n                                Cisco FMC Software Release              First Fixed Release\r\n              Hotfix Patch\r\n                                              Earlier than 6.1.01              Migrate to a fixed release.\r\n              Not available.\r\n                                  6.1.0              Migrate to a fixed release.

Cisco FMC Software releases 6.0.1 and earlier have reached end of software maintenance. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n2. Customers who are running a 6.2.0, 6.2.1, or 6.2.2 release should migrate either to a release that integrates the fix or to a release for which a hotfix patch is available. For example, customers could migrate to Release 6.2.3 and then install the hotfix patch, which is Sourcefire_3D_Defense_Center_S3_Hotfix_DO-6.2.3.16-3.sh.REL.tar.\r\n\r\n3. Cisco FMC Software Release 6.5.0.1 integrates a fix for this vulnerability; however, it is no longer available for download.\r\n\r\nCustomers who are running the following Cisco FMC Software releases can remediate by doing the following:\r\n\r\n      Releases earlier than 6.1.0: Migrate to a 6.2.3 release and apply available hotfixes.\r\n      6.1.0: Apply the hotfix listed in the preceding table or migrate to a 6.2.3 release and apply available hotfix.\r\n      6.2.0 through 6.2.2: Migrate to a 6.2.3 release and apply available hotfix.\r\n      6.2.3 or 6.3.0: Apply available hotfixes; maintenance releases will be available later this year.\r\n      6.4.0: Apply available hotfixes or upgrade to Release 6.4.0.7.\r\n      6.5.0: Upgrade to 6.5.0.2.\r\n\r\nCustomers may install a fix either by upgrading to a fixed release or by installing a hotfix patch. The availability of each option for all the supported software releases is documented in the preceding table.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade to a release that includes a fix for this vulnerability or to install a hotfix patch, customers are advised to follow the Cisco Firepower Management Center Upgrade Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/upgrade/fpmc-upgrade-guide.html\"] and then review the appropriate release notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/defense-center/products-release-notes-list.html\"] or, if applicable, review the Firepower Hotfix Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/hotfix/Firepower_Hotfix_Release_Notes.html\"].",
