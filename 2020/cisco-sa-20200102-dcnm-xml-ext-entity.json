				"text": "A vulnerability in the SOAP API of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read access to information that is stored on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative privileges on the DCNM application.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because the SOAP API improperly handles XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting malicious XML content in an API request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the affected device.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The severity of this vulnerability is aggravated by the vulnerabilities described in the Cisco Data Center Network Manager Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200102-dcnm-auth-bypass\"] advisory, published simultaneously with this one.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200102-dcnm-xml-ext-entity [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200102-dcnm-xml-ext-entity\"]",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Fixed Releases\r\nAt the time of publication, Cisco DCNM Software releases 11.3(1) and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nSee the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n\r\nTo download the software from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home\"] on Cisco.com, do the following:\r\n\r\nClick Browse All.\r\nChoose Cloud and Systems Management > Data Center Infrastructure Management > Data Center Network Manager.\r\nChoose a release from the left pane of the Data Center Network Manager page.",
