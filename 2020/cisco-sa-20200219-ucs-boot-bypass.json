				"text": "A vulnerability in the firmware of the Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers could allow an authenticated, physical attacker to bypass Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Secure Boot validation checks and load a compromised software image on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to improper validation of the server firmware upgrade images. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a server firmware version that would allow the attacker to disable UEFI Secure Boot. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the signature validation checks that are done by UEFI Secure Boot technology and load a compromised software image on the affected device. A compromised software image is any software image that has not been digitally signed by Cisco.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200219-ucs-boot-bypass [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200219-ucs-boot-bypass\"]",

				"text": "UEFI Secure Boot was created to enhance security in the pre-boot environment. The core issue is ensuring that a system boots without introducing compromised code.\r\n\r\nEnsuring that boot code is executed without modification requires the use of a digital signature that is provided by a trusted code creator and embedded in every executable code section. Using public/private key pairs, the code creator ���signs��� their code with a private key, which can be checked against a public key in a pre-stored signature before it is executed.\r\n\r\nBecause of the UEFI Secure Boot feature, the software images for the affected products are all signed by the Cisco development teams to ensure that they have not been tampered with.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the UEFI Secure Boot feature, see the Secure Boot in Modern Computer Security Solutions [\"https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Secure_Boot_in_Modern_Computer_Security_Solutions_2019.pdf\"] document.",

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Customers Without Service Contracts\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nCustomers are advised to upgrade their appliances as indicated in the Remediation column of the following table:\r\n        Cisco Hardware Platform  First Fixed BIOS Version  First Fixed Cisco IMC Firmware Release\r\n  Remediation          FMC 1000, 2500, and 4500  4.0.1f.0  4.0.2h  Apply Hotfix CJ [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/hotfix/Firepower_Hotfix_Release_Notes/available-hotfixes.html#Cisco_Reference.dita_c236fea7-4b1c-4952-bf42-41ee3ff2c5da\"].
