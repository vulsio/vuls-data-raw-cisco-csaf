				"text": "On February 26th, 2020, researchers ��tefan Svorenc��k and Robert Lipovsky disclosed a vulnerability in the implementation of the wireless egress packet processing of certain Broadcom Wi-Fi chipsets. This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to decrypt Wi-Fi frames without the knowledge of the Wireless Protected Access (WPA) or Wireless Protected Access 2 (WPA2) Pairwise Temporal Key (PTK) used to secure the Wi-Fi network.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability exists because after an affected device handles a disassociation event it could send a limited number of Wi-Fi frames encrypted with a static, weak PTK. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by acquiring these frames and decrypting them with the static PTK. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt Wi-Fi frames without the knowledge of the security session establishment used to secure the Wi-Fi network.\r\n\r\n\r\nMultiple Cisco wireless products are affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200226-wi-fi-info-disclosure [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200226-wi-fi-info-disclosure\"]",

A number of Wi-Fi frames still buffered in the hardware egress queue could then be transmitted while encrypted with a static, weak PTK.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to acquire Wi-Fi frames encrypted with the static PTK:\r\n\r\nTriggering the disassociation event by injecting malicious packets into the wireless network and capturing the frames sent after the event.\r\nPassively listening to traffic from the wireless network and capturing the frames sent after a disassociation event.\r\n\r\nThe frames affected by the weak encryption are the only ones present in the hardware egress buffer during the processing of a disassociation event. Further frames will not be accepted or queued. Under no circumstances can the attacker control the content or number of frames.
