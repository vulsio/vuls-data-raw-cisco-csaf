An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view information that they are not authorized to view, make changes to the system that they are not authorized to make, or execute commands within the underlying operating system that may affect the availability of the device.\r\n\r\n\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2019-15984\r\n\r\nCisco Data Center Network Manager SOAP API SQL Injection Vulnerability\r\n\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the SOAP API of Cisco DCNM could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary SQL commands on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the API.

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Releases\r\nCisco fixed these vulnerabilities in Cisco DCNM Software releases 11.3(1) and later.\r\n\r\nTo download the software from the Software Center [\"https://software.cisco.com/download/home\"] on Cisco.com, do the following:\r\n\r\nClick Browse All.\r\nChoose Cloud and Systems Management > Data Center Infrastructure Management > Data Center Network Manager.\r\nChoose a release from the left pane of the Data Center Network Manager page.",
