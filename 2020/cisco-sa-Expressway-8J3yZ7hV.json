As a result of this feature, interfaces such as the Cisco Expressway web administrative interface may become accessible from external networks.\r\n\r\nAt the time of publication, documentation of the feature did not properly explain that users are able to bypass firewall protections that are designed to restrict access to the Cisco Expressway web administrative interface. However, an attacker must have credentials sufficient to use TURN services to be able to send network requests to the web administrative interface.\r\n\r\n",
