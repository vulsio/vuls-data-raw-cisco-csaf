				"text": "A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an NX-API system process to unexpectedly restart.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect validation of the HTTP header of a request that is sent to the NX-API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the NX-API on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition in the NX-API service; however, the Cisco NX-OS device itself would still be available and passing network traffic.\r\n\r\nNote: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200226-nxos-api-dos [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200226-nxos-api-dos\"]",

The NX-API feature is disabled by default. To determine whether an affected device is configured with the NX-API feature enabled, administrators can use the show feature | include nxapi command from the Cisco NX-OS CLI and verify that the feature is enabled. The following example shows the NX-API feature enabled on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software:\r\n\r\n\r\nnxos-switch# show feature | include nxapi\r\nnxapi                1        enabled",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n  Cisco NX-OS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software, platform, and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release���for example, 7.0(3)I7(5) for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or 14.0(1h) for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:\r\n              Cisco NX-OS Software      Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode                  MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches      Nexus 1000V Series Switches      Nexus 3000 Series Switches      Nexus 5000 Series Switches      Nexus 6000 Series Switches      Nexus 7000 Series Switches      Nexus 9000 Series Switches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.\r\n      Additional Resources\r\nFor help determining the best Cisco NX-OS Software release for a Cisco Nexus Switch, administrators can refer to the following Recommended Releases documents. If a security advisory recommends a later release, Cisco recommends following the advisory guidance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisco MDS Series Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/mds9000/sw/b_MDS_NX-OS_Recommended_Releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 1000V for VMware Switch [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus1000/sw/recommended_releases/b_Cisco_N1KV_VMware_MinRecommendedReleases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/recommended_release/b_Minimum_and_Recommended_Cisco_NX-OS_Releases_for_Cisco_Nexus_3000_Series_Switches.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 5500 Platform Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5500/sw/release/recommended_releases/n5500_recommended_nx-os_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 5600 Platform Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus5600/sw/release/recommended_releases/n5600_recommended_nx-os_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 6000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus6000/sw/release/recommended_releases/recommended_nx-os_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/sw/nx-os/recommended_releases/recommended_nx-os_releases.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches [\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/recommended_release/b_Minimum_and_Recommended_Cisco_NX-OS_Releases_for_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_Switches.html\"]\r\nCisco Nexus 9000 Series ACI-Mode Switches [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/recommended-release/b_Recommended_Cisco_ACI_Releases.html\"]\r\n  To determine the best release for Cisco UCS, see the Recommended Releases documents in the release notes for the device.",
