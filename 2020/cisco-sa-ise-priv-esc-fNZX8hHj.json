				"text": "A vulnerability in the Microsoft Active Directory integration of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have a valid administrator account on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to incorrect privilege assignment. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the system with a crafted Active Directory account. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain root privileges on an affected device.\r\n\r\nNote: Only devices that have the CLI configured to support Active Directory authentication are affected by this vulnerability. CLI support for Active Directory authentication is disabled by default. All other uses of Active Directory Domain Services or Active Directory Certificate Services within ISE are not affected.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThis advisory is available at the following link:\r\nhttps://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-priv-esc-fNZX8hHj [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-priv-esc-fNZX8hHj\"]",

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n      Fixed Releases\r\nAt the time of publication, Cisco ISE releases 2.6 Patch 9 and later, 2.7 Patch 3 and later, and releases 3.0 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nImportant: Cisco ISE 3.0 is a smart licensing-only solution that requires communication to the cloud. Cisco ISE 3.0 does not support air-gapped networks until Release 3.0 Patch 2.\r\n\r\nSee the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.",
