An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the associated service set identifier (SSID) and sending ICMPv6 traffic. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send ICMPv6 traffic prior to RUN state.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability.

If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n        Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (���First Fixed���). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (���Combined First Fixed���).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release���for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.\r\n\r\nFor a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032\"], Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754\"], or Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252\"], depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.",
